"Gloucester City, NJ",4/3/2020,5.0,"Ordered from here during the pandemic, great food for pick up.. Service was nice and easy . buffalo cinnamon prosciutto pizza was delicious. Great homemade beers"
"Mount Laurel, NJ",5/15/2020,5.0,"Such a great place! I came here about 2 months ago with my fiance for a quick lunch, and everything was phenomenal.We ended up ordering way more than we wanted, but we ordered beer cheese + pretzel (delish), fries, and a 3rd item which I can't remember. We also ordered 1 beer and 1 mimosa. Our waiter was attentive however, I think he forgot about our fries for awhile. By the time they came out, we were stuffed. We parked in a free lot and walked over to vault. I love the small town vibes the street has! I felt like it was right out of a Hallmark movie! Definitely recommend!"
"Philadelphia, PA",6/21/2020,3.0,"Food is good, service subpar. We arrived and were told to wear a mask inside when going to the host stand. They weren't enforcing this, and most people weren't even wearing a mask. Whatever, but if you are going to have a rule, please enforce it. We were sat at our table, given one paper menu to share amongst the whole table of 6. Who knows if it was a new menu. It felt damp. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a reusable menu? So everyone can have their own and toss it out after?Service was so slow, no water refills, waitress would leave before we could even ask for extra napkins and water.The duck and apple pizza was excellent. I did enjoy the pork belly fingerling fries as well. I enjoyed my blackberry drip beer, although I tasted none of the flavors noted."
"Yardley, PA",3/17/2020,5.0,Love this brewery There are no TV's which is good for great conversation The beer is very good too!
"trenton, NJ",10/27/2019,4.0,"This restaurant/bar really reminds me of my old stomping grounds in Haddon Township NJ and especially a restaurant I used to frequent called Keg and Kitchen. This restaurant is located in an old bank building, hence the name. It definitely has an interesting interior, there is also outdoor seating and more traditional seating outside the vault area. I hear it gets pretty busy at prime bar hours, however we came here around 5 pm on a Thursday evening and there was ample seating available both indoors and out. I would think it's best to come here with a group of people as they had big platters for $17-$20 that could feed probably 4-5 people and the food looked really good. They also had a really nice selection of seasonal craft beers. We got the mushroom pizza and waffle grilled cheese. The crust of the mushroom pizza was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, just right. Keg and Kitchen makes the same pizza, mushrooms, arugula, and truffle oil, but K&K's tastes a lot better for some reason. I couldn't really put my finger on it. I think it might be the truffle oil but I'm uncertain. The waffle grilled cheese was served with a quarter bowl of tomato dipping soup. It was really good. The only thing missing was the crispy toasted flavor. The food was good, but not amazing. Drinks and atmosphere were great. Four stars."
"Washington Crossing, PA",3/13/2020,5.0,"My boyfriend and i were looking for a cool, new place togo & we found that at Vault! Awesome ambiance, good food, good drinks & great music! We will definitely be back!"
"Warrington, PA",2/23/2020,4.0,"Recently visited Vault Brewing as my dad and I have been trying out local breweries across Bucks County. I was supper excited to try this place out as it has been on my list for a while. We went on a Saturday and got there around 4 or 4:30pm & it was packed! Definitely thinking of trying to do reservations next time. We were seated right away but seating in general is really close together so things were a little tight but not unbearable.My dad & I each ordered the same beer--the Warm & Fuzzy in Bucks County, an exclusive beer for the BC Ale Trail. It was super good! I definitely want to come back to try out some of Vault's other beers. My mom got a mixed drink which she didn't end up really likening it. I felt a bit bad because she didn't end up really liking her meal either. She said it didn't have anything to do with the restaurant, just that she thought she'd like it but ended up not liking the chicken. We did all however love the raspberry chipotle chicken bites. They were soooo good! I'd definitely recommend them!My dad ordered the crab cake sliders & I ordered the waffle grilled cheese. We both really liked our meals!My mom & I also ordered dessert. I got the s'more wIth peanut butter & my mom got the special: a strawberry mousse dessert. We both really loved the desserts (although the s'more was a bit messy to eat-be warned lol).Overall, good food & good beers. Will be back!"
"Philadelphia, PA",5/16/2019,4.0,"We were in the area so decided to stop in and try them out. There's indoor seating and outdoor patio seating, and most of the people were seated outside with a pup accompanying them on this warm Saturday afternoon. No wait to be seated, but there was a good amount of people there. They only let you sit inside if you're ordering food? Okay.They had a good amount of beer for a small brewery, but not too much variety. The most unique one they had was a sweet potato beer, although everything did taste pretty good. Two flights, and we were able to try just about everything. They also have sangria, wine, ciders, and cocktails.We also split the hummus to have with the beer. It came with black bean hummus, red pepper hummus, and avocado hummus- and they were all tasty, although the avocado hummus was different. It was served with pita bread, carrots, celery, and I believe what was little pieces of red bell pepper, which was a nice touch.Everything was very summery, so they probably rotate based on the season. I'd definitely come back another season to try some more of their brews."
"Philadelphia, PA",11/7/2019,5.0,"I was craving oven brick pizza and found this place on the internet. I decided to try it for the first time tonight and this place did not disappoint. The pizza was flavorful and even the Cuban sandwich was great! Not to mention, the service was good too. I wanted to switch table and the waiter had no problem with it. The food came out pretty quick! Highly recommend!"
"Universal City, TX",9/13/2019,4.0,"Clearly a locals' eatery and bar, the folks at Vault made this out-of-towner feel welcome. From the moment I walked in and was greeted by a polite and friendly hostess, to the fact the servers kept an eye on each other's tables ensuring my drink was never empty... the service was exceptional.I ordered the Cuban and opted for the caprese upgrade as my side. The mozzarella, tomato, and basil medley was refreshing, with the sweetness of the balsamic balancing it nicely. The Cuban was delicious... a perfect combination of salty and briny, pickled goodness. Though I would have preferred a yellow mustard option to the Vault's stone ground.I usually take my Old Fashioned with rye, but I have no complaints about the house's bourbon Old Fashioned. It was executed perfectly with hints of bitters and orange.My only real complaint is the seating options. Unless dining outside, you'll be seated at a high top table inside. The chairs are uncomfortable. It's unfortunate because had I been more comfortable, I would have happily ordered dessert and another drink. A small annoyance in an otherwise great experience. Cheers!"
"San Francisco, CA",6/22/2020,5.0,I love this place! I have been coming here every once and a while since they opened up. They definitely have the best pizza in the area and they are a Brewery not a Pizzeria lol. I have known people to work here throughout the years and they have all said that they love working here. Its also a great atmosphere whether you want to take your kids out for dinner or if you and the boys want to throw some back on a saturday night.
"Hightstown, NJ",11/30/2018,5.0,"Obsessed. This place is the bomb-diggity! Cute town first off & cool vibe inside to hang out at, kind of dark and swanky--outdoors in the summertime. Note: Bathroom is downstairs. The beer... diverse options, quality. They have a sweet potato one in the fall which is neat, and in the summer one that reminds me of a dry chardonnay. Good stuff.My favorite thing of all is the brick oven PIZZA however. They are PHENOMENAL. They have unique toppings and seasonal specials such as a Thanksgiving pie with turkey/fixins.A run down of those I have had:1. Brown Sugar Buffalo = life changing. Spicy, smoky, yet sweet with baked prosciutto giving it a hammy warmth. A staple to order when visiting there. I don't typically like prosciutto either, but that's ancient history with this pie!2. Wild Mushroom = also pretty delicious. More tame flavor wise, but very shroomy if you are a lover of them (as I am). Caramelized onions really make this one.3. Duck & Apple = the reason I got hooked on this place. This was the first pie I ever tried there, and I was blown away by the combinations of flavors in 1 bite. The bacon with the blue cheese and sweet honey/apples with tasty, shredded duck... I am drooling right now. So very unique.The sandwiches are also very quality and filling. Brisket is tender and garlicy, & Asian-inspired pork belly sandwich definitely has a kick. Friendly service and fun hangs. Vault is a must."
"Leesburg, VA",5/5/2019,5.0,"I love the Vault.I've spent many a great evening here. The Vault isn't a sh1tty sportsbar with loud music. There are no TeeVees (plus!) and there is no blaring music (also a plus) so you can ... you know ... talk with your friends. I'm here for good conversation, booze, and good food - THE VAULT DELIVERS! If you're a beer snob, you'll be pleased with their brews - the brewery is a centerpiece of the bar/restaurant. The food is absolutely excellent. Always had a fantastic salad here (good variety of greens - that's huge) and their pizzas are the best. Can't complain about anything.Highly recommended if you're nearby."
"Pittsburgh, PA",4/18/2020,5.0,Great food and brews! The outside seating is really cozy. A must if you are in Yardley.
"PA, PA",1/24/2020,5.0,"After moving to Bucks County, I'd say we've definitely eaten at Vault the most and tried a great deal of the menu. Pizza standouts are the Duck Apple, Brown Sugar Buffalo and Wild Mushroom. From the sandwich and burger side, our favorites are the Crab Cake Sliders and the Yardley Burger (the brie on this is really really good). The appetizers are all great as well. The only thing that's a miss for me is the pork belly fries. I know it says it right in the description that they are fingerling potatoes, but a fingerling potato is not a fry. If you had a big group, I'm sure they're good for sharing because the flavors are there and the sauces taste great, but for just two people it's a lot of potato.Overall, one of my favorite brew pubs ever."
"Hammond, LA",4/2/2020,5.0,I'm a beer cheese FANATIC. Best beer cheese I've had in my life. I'm obsessed. Quality food and experience and buffalo brown sugar pizza is a forever favorite. Thanks for being the best in yardley. Pricey but worth it.
"Levittown, PA",4/13/2019,4.0,"I came here today for dinner with my friend and brought my dog along, and sat on the patio outside in the wonderful weather. Upon arrival, we were told that seating would take 30-45 minutes. We were almost going to just leave, but there weren't a whole lot of restaurants in the area with outdoor seating. Thankfully we stayed because seating probably only took about 20 minutes.Perhaps the biggest complaint was the timing of everything... The waitresses took quite a long time to bring drinks and the meal, and clear the table, and they weren't quite as attentive as I believe they should've been. (It took maybe an entire extra 25 minutes after the appetizer was done to get our main courses. And at one point there were almost 6-7 different glasses from finished and new drinks all on the table together.) However, the wait staff was friendly to both my dog, my friend, and I, so that was a plus.The food itself was really good. As a starter, we had the pork belly fries. They were more like regular potatoes than fries. They were covered in cheese and pork belly (similar to chicharrones if you've had them), and had two sauces on the side: a green one that was reminiscent of kale and that I didn't find to be too good, and a spicy delicious red sauce that perfectly complemented the potatoes and meat. The taste was absolutely delicious. The only bad thing about the dish was the sheer level of grease. Upon finishing, a pool of grease was at the bottom of the plate. I suspect it was from the fat of the melted cheese, along with the fat from the pork belly, and that perhaps extra cooking fat was used to cook the potatoes.For our main dishes, we had the Cuban sandwich along with the waffle grilled cheese sandwich. We chose sweet potato chips as our side (as opposed to salad). The grilled cheese also came with a very small bowl of tomato soup. The sandwiches were both VERY good, especially the waffle grilled cheese. Although I wish it was a bit more crisply toasted, the waffle grilled cheese was excellent. The fluffy texture of the waffle bread with a slight sweetness from the batter, combined with gooey melty cheese, and dipped in flavorful, well seasoned tomato soup was everything I could ask for in a grilled cheese. The Cuban had the right balance of ingredients throughout the sandwich, in the right ratios so that each flavor complemented the next. Each sandwich was a little on the small side for the price, though. ($13.50 per sandwich.)I'd certainly come back here. Aside from how busy it was, leading the wait staff to be less attentive, the food was also quite pricey. For two sodas, a Cuban sandwich, a grilled cheese, and the pork belly fries, the bill was about $50. Overall, I enjoyed the environment and the overall experience. I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves bar food with a delicious twist."
"Freehold Township, NJ",9/25/2018,3.0,"I was excited to try this place, as it had such great reviews. The night we went they were supposed to have a jazz band playing, but they didn't come on until much later. I ordered the hummus plate and the prosciutto and fig salad. The hummus plate was pretty good, a little lackluster--it just seemed so plain. The salad had a little too much prosciutto so it was super salty. What especially turned me off this place was the service. We were given a dirty plate, which they replaced. But then they forgot about one of the beers in our flight until we reminded them and then it came about ten minutes later. Our waitress was a little difficult to find so the entire night was a little annoying."
"Allendale, NJ",12/8/2019,4.0,"3 appetizers were like main dishes; chicken meatballs, cheese platter and buffalo cauliflower. Nothing like combing these with a craft beer (or more). The chicken meatballs were served over greens and the cauliflower on a thin bed of dressing. Just really a good evening. Leave you age at the door. Kids to seniors were all here tonight. Right in the holiday season; just a nice might"
"Langhorne, PA",3/11/2020,5.0,This place is definitely unique and lives up to its name. The art is thought through and has some one of a kind pieces. The pizza is definitely amazing if you are into something like that. I was here for the beer and really liked the orange creamy ipa. I had the crab cake sliders and they were done right and delicious. Place was packed a bit but we got service pretty fast. One of the best local breweries hands down
"Hamilton, NJ",9/17/2019,5.0,"Even though I've been here a dozen times I still order a flight just to try what's new and old favorites (like hops and clouds). Unlike some breweries, this is a full restaurant and full bar for your non-beer-indulging friends. Highlights- buffalo cauliflower that I could order every day. Great variety of thin crust pies. A decent Cuban sandwich with a twist. Fun salads and a s'more for dessert, especially great if you bring kids. Family friendly. Efficient staff. And the new covered patio with heaters will take this place into the deep fall."
"Hamilton Township, NJ",10/12/2019,2.0,"Second time there. It's always filled with people, which is a good thing for a business. Both time were very underwhelming experiences for my wife and I though. We asked to try two beers and we were brought full-sized glasses. When we explained that we'd only wanted to try them before we ordered one, they were taken away and two flight glasses were brought back dripping wet. Not that big of a deal. Just a misunderstanding. We did order two beers, not those though.I really wanted a burger and the grass-fed beef burger sounded great. I ordered it medium-rare. The burger I got was maybe a third the size of the bun and well done. The side of chips that come with the burger were just crumbs--not a whole chip in the cup. More than 10 minutes went by before anyone asked how the food was. When our server did come back, I pointed out the chips and the fact that the burger was fairly sad looking. I stressed that I didn't want to make a big deal about it and that I'd just eat the burger; but, if that was the usual qualify and presentation it was seriously lacking.The burger wasn't good. It had the consistency of blender-processed meat. And really lacked any flavor besides the oozing white cheddar (I think?) that the oversized bun.When I finally got a proper side of chips, they weren't bad. I think most people expect fries with a burger though. Whenever w get chips I think it's a money-saving tactic.Lastly, the Vault is a pretty cool old bank building. The problem is that there are fabric textures and lots of nooks and crannies for dust to accumulate--and it has. The tops of the exposed HVAC pipes are dusty. The fabric sound deadening panels are very dusty. The ledges are dusty. It's a shame.If they'd take the time to properly manage the guest experience, that place would be awesome. They'd make more than what they do now on locals at the bar. We'll probably be back but it will be a long while until then."
"Doylestown, PA",10/20/2019,4.0,"Very nice place. We had a gift card for Vault and it's a bit out of the way for us, but great experience. Service, food and ambiance was top notch. I had a cocktail (I know) and my wife sampled the beer. Had the buffalo chicken salad, hummus appetizer and chicken sandwich and everything was enjoyed.I'd go back when I'm in the area, for sure."
"Trenton, NJ",10/4/2019,4.0,The vault is very good. They have wonderful food with many great options. The pretzel braid was so good. For our entrees we got the crab cake sliders and brisket sandwhiches. They were both very good and we enjoyed them very much.
"Tuckerton, NJ",10/14/2019,2.0,"It was ok, nothing special. They are known for their beer (which is good), maybe they should just stick with that. My hubby and I went for brunch yesterday morning, I had the portobello Bennie and he got the biscuits and gravy. I wish I had gotten a pic of his, there was barely any gravy on it. My portobello Bennie had a hard boiled egg on top. I think their kitchen staff should learn how to cook a poached egg, Benedicts are supposed to have poached eggs! Portobello mushrooms are big, right? I guess not at the vault, it was barely covering the English muffin. I feel like for the price it was, it wasn't good at all, the hollandaise was lacking flavor also.  I definitely will not be rushing back here anytime soon for brunch."
"Philadelphia, PA",7/26/2018,4.0,"Second time here and liked it even better the second time around!  The place is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside, with 3 dining areas, as well as tables outside.  The staff are all young, energetic and informed.It's a place where you can just stop in for a beer or enjoy numerous tempting items from their menu.  We did the latter, starting off with a shared and delicious Cucumber Lime Gazpacho, along with an equally delicious Harvest Beet salad, consisting of Gold & Red Candy-cane beets, Frisee, Goat cheese & toasted Hazelnuts. We followed this up with their fantastic Duck & Apple Pizza. This is Duck confit, Gala apples, Candied bacon, Caramelized onions, Mozzarella & Bleu cheese, with some Honey on a thin crust.  Amazing!With 2 in-house brewed beers (both very good), before tip, the bill came to around $46.00 - we definitely will be back."
"Mount Holly, NJ",8/17/2019,5.0,This was a nice lunch with my sister.  The beer and cocktails were great!  The food was superb.  We were happy with everything.
"Ewing Township, NJ",3/2/2020,4.0,"The service at Vault can be a little lacking because they are always busy, but the beer is great and the food is awesome. I highly recommend their sour beers and the waffle grilled cheese. Oh! And the arugula pizza! Yum yum!"
"Branchburg, NJ",1/6/2019,4.0,"Another brewery with a nice restaurant feel/atmosphere. Definitely try a flight to gain an appreciation for the diverse selection of beers here. My fiancee and I tried the bacon slab special to start, which was nicely seasoned/cooked but surprisingly cold. Not sure if that was the intention but we would have preferred it served warm (as most bacon usually is). Our second starter, the pork belly fries, completely made up for the bacon mishap. They definitely use high quality potatoes, cut to a fingerling size and loaded with melted cheese. I loved the creamy texture and buttery taste of the potatoes. My fiancee ordered the brisket sandwich which was decent, but the better sandwich was the Cuban. Again it was missing that level of heat to really fuse all the layers together and give a crisp crunch to the bread - but taste was on point. The side salad was actually delicious and I loved the balsamic dressing. Overall there were some inconsistencies food-wise, but our server was excellent and the atmosphere/beers made up for some of the other shortcomings. Would come back again to try more dishes and give it another shot to earn 5 stars."
"Langhorne, PA",3/17/2019,4.0,"My last visit years ago when it opened was underwhelming, but I've heard some good things recently, so we had a guys night out and despite the wait, enjoyed ourselves.  Packed inside with an hour wait (St. Patty's day eve mind you).  They have a system of taking your name and phone number, but the combo of bad cell service inside, live music and the room being loud, we missed our call.  Not a strike, more of a note to others.The décor of the place still has its bank theme and the wood fired copper oven is a great touch.  Despite being packed, the service at the bar and our waitress was very prompt.  The kitchen was well manned and we didn't wait long for our grub.  The beer list had a nice mix stouts, IPA's (thank you for having a West Coast IPA!), a Belgian and a Pils.  The Irish Potato Stout was a nice addition on nitro and despite lacking more coconut it was very sessionable with a nice spicy cinnamon bite.  I enjoyed it as a starter.  Moved on to the Everything's Gonna Be Alright IPA which was fresh, hoppy (slightly too sweet), but piney, rindy, bitter and grapefruity just the way I like 'em.  My nightcap/liquid dessert was the In the Stillness Imperial Stout.  The ABV 9.6% was hidden very well and the silky, creaminess of a cask conditioned Imperial Stout combined with a tart berry and chocolate flavor made it a home run for me. Now on to the food, I had a Cuban sandwich which was served on a long pressed ciabatta roll, had slow roasted pork, chorizo, ham, swiss cheese, dill pickle and stone ground mustard.  The pork inside was excellent flavor wise and moist, the balance of ham, pickle and mustard flavors was noticeable and appreciated!  My buddies raved about the pork belly fries which are actually quartered fingerling potatoes and their Italian sausage pizza came out looking great and was just right for two.  The prices weren't bad $40 for a night out wasn't too shabby.  The pizza's were being ordered like crazy here and being a significant portion of their menu it's obviously one of their staples.  Sitting next to the pass thru they all looked tasty as heck.  I'm really glad these guys are making it happen here.  The beer was average to above average, menu isn't crazy and complicated, the food was great and the atmosphere was friendly and felt welcoming.  Our waitress and the bartenders were friendly and with how busy it was weren't breaking a sweat.Keep up the good work!"
"Philadelphia, PA",7/31/2019,5.0,Stopped by here for drinks one night and decided to get food as well. We had the cheese board as an appetizer and the Margherita pizza. Both were great. The beer was good as well. We sat outside on the porch and it was a really nice summer night. Really recommend this place if you want to have conversation over good food and drinks.
"Ewing Township, NJ",4/27/2019,5.0,This place never lets us down! It's a great casual atmosphere with positive helpful staff and amazing food. And of course the beers are always so delicious !  They do a great job of developing different flavors and exploring.The food is just alway on point from the simple kale and couscous salad and buffalo cauliflower (better than you can imagine) to the unique pizza toppings. We love this place so much. It's been a favorite for over 2 years since we started coming and it will always be one of our top go-to spots for a casual lunch or dinner.
"Montclair, NJ",5/31/2018,4.0,"First time and so enjoyed our lunch. I tried their fruity IPA with hibiscus. So good. Wished I had brought growlers.We each ordered a pizza. Could have shared one but now have glorious leftovers. One of their brown sugar ones, crazy good. The other mushroom with some arugula. Very good too.Servers pleasant. One oddity. They kept moving tables in from patio. They did apologize. But as we were right by the door, all that furniture moving was distracting.One issue: deep stairs down to rest room with little stair lighting. Add some light.Cool overall setting. Nice food and beer. Will return when in the Yardley area again."
"Pigeon Forge, TN",3/1/2020,4.0,Great venue for drinks. Food is delicious and much better to share than have all to yourself. I did notice the women working the hostess station seemed absolutely miserable. Or maybe they just aren't enthusiastic about their work? It kind of killed my vibe initially. The wait staff and bartenders were all energetic and kept the mood up with great service though! I love the live music too. Definitely will be returning.
"Charlotte, NC",1/8/2020,4.0,The beer selection is great and the wait staff is very friendly.  The food was very good from the wide range of options for non vegetarians to vegetarians.  On a nice day taking a beer and sitting outside is great.  The inside is a log bigger than it appears and the way they have designed the entire building is amazing.
"Trenton, NJ",1/17/2020,3.0,Limited menu and not a place to go unless you're into craft beer and breweries.  I have gone to other breweries and they still were a decent place to eat.  Attractive decor.
"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/1/2019,3.0,"We came on a Sunday evening and the wait was less than 10 min. Our party of 4 were seated by the wood fired oven. My friends and I were excited from reading all the yelp reviews and then seeing all the delicious food ready to be picked up. We ordered - pork belly fries - loved the aiolis that accompanied the fries- harvest beets salad- duck & apple pizza - the candied bacon, apples, and honey made the pizza too sweet for me. My other friends liked it though.- wild mushroom pizza - this was the best out of everything I ate. The garlic truffle ricotta was the star of this pizza.Service was OK. I docked a star because everyone in our party got sick within an hour of leaving the restaurant. We were raving about the food while we ate. Just sucks that we got sick."
"Gaithersburg, MD",6/11/2019,3.0,The first things you notice here is the fact they left pieces of the old bank including the vault doors turned into wine storage and refrigeration. Also the the iron bars on the bar is neat. The beer I had was pretty good and seems to have a decent selection. As for food I had some of the duck and apple pizza as well as the wild mushroom one. I preferred the wild mushroom pizza. We shared the beet salad which was also very nice. They didn't have a kids menu so the 2 kids in our group shared the waffle grilled cheese sandwich. My son didn't really like it mainly because it was too spicy.
"Yardley, PA",2/12/2020,3.0,"Great food, good beer, bad service. Don't eat here unless you really like the people you came with cause you'll be with them awhile."
"Philadelphia, PA",1/10/2018,5.0,"I came here for an Orangetheory Fitness holiday party. I really liked the idea of it being after the holidays & at a brewery. I heard nothing but good things about Vault. I guess I am a true blonde because I never made the correlation that it used to be a bank. Parking can be tough but there is a parking lot behind and one adjacent to the brewery. When you first walk in there is a large bar and a few circle tables in front of it. We were in a private room downstairs, it said it held 60 people but it honestly was a little tight. Just keep that in mind if you are thinking if renting it out. I decided to try their blonde ale. I am nit a big beer lover however I do enjoy a nice pale ale and this was delicious with 6%. I would like to go back and try some of their other beers, I did have a taste of the Sweet Potato beer & it was just as good, even though it wasn't a pale ale. I was surprised to see they had plenty of wine options from local wineries so its the perfect place to come to please everyone. I really liked that they supported local wineries. We were served pizza & a garden salad, buffet style. I absolutely loved their Margarita pizza, cooked perfectly on thin crust with fresh chucks of mozzarella, fresh basil and balsamic drizzled on top. If I lived closer, I would be getting this pizza regularly. I also tried the mushroom pizza that came with sautéed onions. It was good but I probably should of had it first because it didn't compare to the margarita.  I would like to come back and try other items off of their menu. The bartenders & servers were super attentive & friendly. I highly recommend this place wether for happy hour, dinner or a night out."
"Philadelphia, PA",7/5/2019,4.0,"Good brew pub with very tasty food menu. Tried the sampler beer selection and was very good. Had the buffalo cauliflower and pork belly fries as apps and were excellent. Had the brown sugar pizza and cheesesteak pizza as entree.  Wasn't s fan of the steak pizza but overall, great beer and good grub.Sat on side patio with our pup which was an added bonus. The flies were annoying and would suggest a catcher or something to address. Still go to the Vault! Will be back!"
"Horsham, PA",8/19/2019,4.0,"As always the food is good.  The beer is cold (and good).  The service, that is another story.  We almost finished our appetizers before we got our beers (but will say the appetizers came out quickly).  Very slow and could not find our waitress for quite some time.Waited forever to get a water refill.  Will come back, but if service is bad again, there are too many other places to go to in the future."
"Ewing Township, NJ",8/18/2019,5.0,"Great vibe! Great beer and good menu! We've been at bar and enjoyed an IPA and a nice antipasto! Dining outside on the deck, we enjoyed a great mushroom pizza! During winter and summer visits, the beer choices, wine, small plates and professional staff keep bringing us back!"
"Churchville, PA",12/19/2019,5.0,"We've been coming to the Vault for a while, and we love the atmosphere and the beer, but even the food is strong there. I love sports, so the only negative for me is the lack of TVs, but I don't expect that out of every brewery. Beyond the food and the beer, the service is actually pretty great. There are a handful of bartenders and wait staff that are really awesome - especially Gina. She has been so sweet to my girlfriend and I, and we honest love her at this point. She makes great food recommendations, and we thoroughly enjoy talking to her. We always hope to sit in her area when we're there!"
"Toledo, OH",12/30/2019,5.0,"Hot waiters, yummie food and good beer!  Very fun location with actual vault decor.  Parking lot is behind the location so the door is around front."
"Inwood, NY",3/19/2019,2.0,"This was a pretty bummer experience. My good friend moved here about a month ago and I was visiting for the weekend, and we were really excited to check this spot out. However, this place did not meet our expectations due to the company and staff we were around. When we got there, it was a crowded room and the hostess let us know we could get our drinks at the bar and there was plenty of standing room all around the bar since seating was limited. We went over to the bar, where two gentlemen happened to be leaving and they offered us their seats. We were about to sit down and order our drinks, and a very rude man and his wife swipe our bar seats from us complaining that they've been standing for an hour, and that they'll be taking their seats. My friend and I aren't ones to get in an argument over something like that, but it was pretty crummy. Just rude patrons all around this place. Not the bar's fault, but still.We opted out of beer and decided to get the house cocktails, which were delicious! However, the bartender that served me was incredibly rude. When I went up to get our second round, he looked at me, demanded to see my ID, while he already had my credit card on file. I told him he served me before and I was in the standing area the whole time, and he told me ""No, I didn't serve you"". I told him ""Yes, you did"" and went to go get my ID. Once I returned he told me he did make the mistake and apologized. However, he was impolite and condescending in his delivery and I don't care to be talked to in such a rude manner, especially when I'm paying a $40 tab for 4 small cocktail. He's lucky I still tipped 20% since I know what it's like to work in the service industry. I understand it was St. Patrick's Day weekend, but come on, don't be rude.We won't be coming back."
"Syracuse, NY",9/10/2018,5.0,"What better way to enjoy Monday night football than to order a nice hot pizza?Saw some good pictures and read many favorable reviews about Vault Brewing. Both were on target.Ordered me a margarita pizza with mushrooms and was told by the very friendly waitress that it would be about 10 minutes. That it was.Took a picture of this pizza (salad and Chianti not included!) to give you an idea of the size and look of the pizza. The sauce was tangy and sweet, just the way I like it. There were plenty of mushrooms and enough sauce and mozzarella cheese to satisfy the need.Looking for a place with good pizza at a good price? Look no further."
"Morrisville, PA",11/1/2017,3.0,"I did not have the best experience here today. We decided to walk over to the Vault after a viewing of the Yardley Canal-O-Ween. When walked in I instantly loved the decor of this bank vault turned trendy bar/restaurant option. We were greeted by the hostess who offered us to be seated in the dining room or the basement bar. We opted for the basement bar. After heading down  the stairs we realized that the area was fixed up nicely and we made a good choice. We grabbed s table but needed an extra stool. The lady bar tending immediately told me we could not sit there, we needed to be seated by the hostess. She then called upstairs and stayed on the phone long enough to make it uncomfortable for me to know what we should do next. Finally she told me we could sit where my friends were already sitting and agreed to bring an extra stool. Finally we were seated and my friends all selected a wine of their choice. We opted to skip food after the seating issue. I was opting for a diet soda instead of alcohol. They didn't have any! I understand wanting to offer craft soda but it's s bar. Diet cola is used in lots of drinks! How do they not have any? Everyone drank and enjoyed the wine while I nursed my water. Although the food around us looked delicious I'm not sure if I will return to check it out. Canal-o-ween brings in new customers. Making them feel so uncomfortable isn't a way to make them plan to return."
"Jersey City, NJ",9/25/2017,5.0,"Super fresh and tasty food at a brewery ! My salad was fully loaded with pesto chicken, parm cheese, heirloom tomatoes and was coated in a tangy red pepper vinaigrette. Definitely one of the better salads that I've had at a restaurant, let alone one that specializes in beer and greasy food. Other hits at the table were buffalo calamari and grilled cheese which actually came pressed in a waffle. Despite being at a brewery, my friends and I actually decided to forgo beer and instead tried the blackberry sangria! We didn't want anything too heavy and this was a perfect light and refreshing option.There are a ton of great restaurants in the area, and Vault came highly recommended from my bro + sis in law who live nearby. Will definitely come back next time I'm visiting, especially since I have yet to try any beer!"
"Philadelphia, PA",10/16/2019,5.0,"I love everything about vault. Beers, food, service and ambience is all high quality."
"Fallsington, PA",2/12/2020,4.0,Vault Brewing is a super chill spot. Always some amazing beers on tap and great food.  I'm a huge fan of the Buffalo Brown Sugar Pizza with prosciutto.  All servers were super friendly and assertive.  Only thing I wish they had was more gluten free items on their menu.
"Warrington, PA",9/11/2019,4.0,"Went here for a lunch and to try the beer. Food was very good and service was friendly as well. Walking in you feel the ""oldness""  in the place, it's a good thing, it's a nice place and was very clean. We sat outside and unfortunately there were quite a few bees, not that the ownership had anything to do with that just a heads up. The beer was also very good, I did the flights and enjoyed them all even the sweet potato beer and I'm not a sweet potato fan. It's a bit of a hike for me but if I'm ever in the area I'd try it and if your debating on going there it's worth it."
"Philadelphia, PA",12/16/2019,5.0,"Some of my family and I went to Vault after doing the Shadybrook Farms Christmas lights thing. The cheese board was really good and so was the Yardley burger and Duck and Apple Pizza. My server was really amazing. I think her name was Gina B. Heard her talking about how she does hair. But she was amazingly personable, incredibly friendly and if it was fake, I couldn't tell. She was very patient as my family went through the menu with some trouble because the text on the menu was a little too small. Promote her (if she wants) she's amazing. I also work in the industry, and she's definitely someone I'd like on my team."
"Philadelphia, PA",10/29/2017,3.0,"I stopped here for dinner during the week and had a good time.  There was a bit of a wait but this was understandable because we visited during a peak time.When you walk in you are greeted by a hostess.  Just behind her there are dining tables to the left and a bar to the right.  Behind the bar there are huge vats of ingredients like yeast. There is a doorway leading to another room where the second dining room is located.  The vault from the 1800's is located in here.The food was pretty good.  My group spilt the hummus platter, antipasto try and pork belly fries.  I liked all three, however I don't think the fries were fries more like roasted potatoes.  For my entree I had a Cuban sandwich with sweet potato chips.  The sandwich was just ok-I would have preferred more meat.  For dessert I order the peanut butter s'mores and was underwhelmed.  The cookie was hard and tasted more like gingerbread than graham cracker.  The marshmallow and chocolate were scarce and not melted.Service was handled strangely.  We had 4 different people serve us and bring us food.  In the beginning it was good because we had constant attention from staff but towards the end of the meal they disappeared.I would like to visit again and try some of their other dishes."
"Falls Church, VA",3/5/2020,3.0,"This is my first time here, loved the whole vibe and food is decent. Vegetarian food has limited options"
"Morrisville, PA",12/18/2019,3.0,"Decided to try this place once again, hoping maybe they're a little more organized and again, they were out of anything I ordered (a soda and dessert) and the atmosphere was a little dull. Not sure if I'm ever gonna win here, but I'll try again in a year or so."
"Glenolden, PA",1/20/2019,4.0,Great food and great crowd! Love this place but would like the lights a tad brighter and at least one TV for some sports viewing !
"Ewing Township, NJ",12/10/2019,4.0,"Duck Pizza. If you haven't tried it, get over there and eat one. Wash it down with ANY of their  brews and life cannot get much better than that. (I'm easily pleased when you get your s$&@ right!)"
"Lawrence Township, NJ",3/22/2020,5.0,Love Vault. We try and go every Friday. Such a great vibe. Very different from anything else in the area. It can be a family spot or great for drinks with friends. So happy they are delivering beer right now. Try the orange drips. Delish.
"Bordentown, NJ",1/15/2019,4.0,"We were looking for a place to grab a bite and a craft beer last Sunday afternoon. Yardley Pennsylvania is a beautiful area with a lot of quaint shops and eateries. Vault Brewing is located in an old bank building, which the wife says used to be a wine bar. Inside, there is a pretty big bar with a nice selection of craft beer on tap. They also sell cans and fill growlers. There are no TV's which is fine by me. They have a very small stage for Jazz a couple of nights per week. Just some easy listening jazz playing not too loudly for our visit.We ordered the three hummus sampler and a spinach artichoke pizza. The hummus came out first. Black bean chipotle, avocado and roasted red pepper with plenty of fresh pita, and veggies. This really would have been enough for both of us. I really liked the black bean chipotle. Smokey and spicy! We both like IPA beer, so we ordered the Everything is gonna be alright. It's unfiltered so it's slightly cloudy. Nice and cold with a piney flavor with a bitter, dry finish. I'd highly recommend it! Then the wood fired spinach and artichoke pizza. I'm really pretty traditional when it comes to pizza, but this was a very nice artisan pie. A little bigger than a bar pie, it was plenty for the two of us. The crust was nicely browned and not too crunchy. There was plenty of cheese, spinach and artichoke too. A perfect blend of flavors. If your in Yardley, stop in and have a pint or two with something to eat. It's worth the trip. Service is good and people are nice and friendly."
"San Francisco, CA",5/19/2019,2.0,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Our waitrees kept getting our order wrong, we asked for a large beer, and got a small, and our waitress said ""whatever""! She was rude and annoying. I asked for a milk a milk, and got SOUR milk! Worst expierience ever!"
"Newtown, PA",4/29/2017,4.0,"Vault Brewing Co., as the name suggests, sits in a former bank on Main Street, Yardley, Pa. It has been in operation for a while, and it really seems to have its act together when it comes to the art of brewing beer, and making interesting dishes in the kitchen.  It is often crowded at happy hour, but when I arrived for lunch with a friend, we had the entire vault room to ourselves, and the bar was not busy.  Sadly, because this was also a business lunch, we did not indulge in their golden liquids, but did enjoy their house made root beer.  Service was very good, with knowledgeable and affable dude, who gave us the time needed to chat as we perused their menu.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, although the pizza offerings were tempting. The meal was served on a wood plank with side salad and balsamic dressing. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted/grilled, and the chicken, cheese, aioli and lettuce held together well, and tasted great.  The side salad was mostly green with romaine, escarole, carrot slivers and vinegar. It was okay.  Overall, it was a solid, tasty lunch.  With the root beer and tip it came to $22 per person, which is rich for my blood for a midweek lunch. Still, it was worthwhile to get inside Vault and appreciate how attractive it was in a dark wood, cloudy, kind of way. On this rainy afternoon, it exuded a quiet historic tone that was relaxing. It definitely calls for a return call, when there is time to enjoy their brewer's craft, and deconstruct one of their pizzas or other tapas."
"Philadelphia, PA",4/20/2018,3.0,"Came here recently for lunch with coworkers.  Had an ok meal.The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated quickly.  All waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  Our waitress was nice enough to give a small sample to the two of us who wanted to try one of the craft beers.  I did not get mine, but my coworker did and had a refreshing 16oz beer.  My other coworker was hitting up a fine wine and full-sized refills!We started with an appetizer of pork-belly ""fries"" which was really split fingerling potatoes fried in fat, and had two sauces; one on each side of the plate.  One green for avocado, one orangery for red pepper. There was very minimal pork belly. These fries were great except for the huge number that were burnt blackened.  These were not that good but throughout the dish was uneven as to what got burnt and what didn't.I had a Cubano sandwich which was also uneven in its flavoring with too much mustard and not enough pork and ham.  It was very flat and just fine, not great.  My coworker had a nice sandwich which she enjoyed, and my other coworker was able to get a perfectly made bun-less burger which was snarfed down in no time at all.  That was quite good.We got separate checks, so I did not know the total bill for the three of us.  One really nice thing that I've never seen on a bill was that they were able to split the price of the fries between checks for my friend and I who ate them.I read they have live jazz weekly, which would be a nice bonus to come back to.So, not really thrilled with the food, but service was quite good."
"Bradenton, FL",6/28/2019,5.0,This home grown brewery continues to impress! I just had the brown sugar buffalo pizza and it was fabulous! I tried everything else on the menu but this ...so ..I had too! Great vibe here also! The people here are the reason this place continues to succeed! Oh try the duck and Apple pizza...beyond your dreams!
"Titusville, NJ",9/8/2019,3.0,Food and beer are GREAT. It's on the dark side and very loud. Parking can be a bitch in Yardley.
"Trenton, NJ",6/14/2019,4.0,Its a Thursday night and I'm jonesing for someplace to go.  i have seen it before so I decide to drive out to Vault Brewery in yardley pa.  After driving around I find there is a large back parking lot so I park my Tesla SUV.  Nah its a Hyundai LOL.  There is a cute well lit walkway with a lot of greenery that leads to the front sidewalk.  I walk inside and was immediately floored by the raw iron decor and the flaming wood burning stove.  Due to beautiful weather I opted to eat outdoor.  However next time I will eat indoor just to look at more.  I was greeted by a very nice waitress and ordered a Jack and Ginger.  However I was advised there is no bottle liquor.  She gave me 3 choices so I opted for a whiskey Manhattan that comes out of a keg.  It was very good.  I ordered the 5 piece chicken balls and the mushroom pizza.  The chicken balls came out with a nice spice glaze topping and are the size of golf balls.  They were actually very good.  There are no different size pizzas so if your hungry one pizza is for one person.  My pie came out and you can finish a slice in under 4 bites.  Immediately I noticed the fresh mushroom taste and the softness of the dough.  This pie was excellent I could not eat it fast enough.  I learned that this is mainly a beer oriented restaurant with small food to eat with an upper scale menu so welcome to Yardley.  The reason for 4 star is only because I sat outside.  I will return for the pizza that just melted in my mouth.  I will sit inside and I bet my rating will be a 5.  Go have fun its a nice place.
"Brooklyn, NY",7/22/2018,5.0,"By 6:30 on a Saturday this place is busy.  My husband and I were told it would be a 20 minute wait but I think it may have been less time than that.  While we waited I was able to check our status in the queue on yelp.  We got drinks at the bar that they seamlessly transferred to our food check when we were seated.  Our server was friendly and very attentive even though it was clear she had a bunch of tables.  We ordered the buffalo cauliflower, crab cake sliders, and the duck & apple pizza.  The cauliflower was tasty.  It was not breaded or fried but the tastiest cauliflower dish I've had yet.  It comes with a side of pickled celery that pairs well with the app.  The pizza was the show stopper.  It was delicious!! The only let down were the crab cakes.  The bun was too big for the crab cake and it was a little to fishy tasting."
"Philadelphia, PA",7/18/2017,4.0,"All in all, I'm a fan of Vault. They have a nice selection of beer so there's something for everyone, and you can make your own beer flights which is nice. Also had delicious berry sangria there The food- get. the. pizza. The buffalo brown sugar is a personal favorite- its sweet and salty and spicy and satisfying. Also a huge fan of the brunch pizza, which is heartier and topped with potatoes and bacon. The buffalo cauliflower is also delicious, and for desert either the smores or the black and white make for a tasty sweet bite (both are small). Ambiance- you'll either love it or hate it. At night it's relatively dark in there, and there's often live music so you may end up screaming to talk to your party. Service- prompt and friendly! Definitely worth a stop in. It's usually quite busy so you'll want to put your name in a bit before you actually want to eat!"
"Manhattan, NY",4/11/2019,5.0,"A restaurant/ bar that has given new life to an old bank, The Vault is probably my favorite place in Yardley. A decent food menu and a periodically changing assortment of beer make The Vault worth revisiting. I wasn't planning on having a beer last night at all, but the imperial IPA sounded so good I couldn't resist, and it did not disappoint. I always get the buffallo cauliflower, it has a nice spice to it and provides a good alternative if you're trying to stay on the (slightly) healthier side, the only way this could be improved is if they were able to make it crispier. The salads are also good, we had the house which came with a delicious balsamic vinaigrette, and the chicken & greens salad, which was also really pleasant. We also had the chipotle chicken bites, which were covered in a nice glaze and on a bed of a salad. Everything was delicious as always. My only slight criticism is that The Vault doesn't have a full bar, but only pre batched cocktails, so they cannot accommodate simple requests like to have a cocktail with vodka instead of gin."
"Manayunk, Philadelphia, PA",1/19/2019,4.0,"First time here after someone recommended vault brewery. We got, brown sugar buffalo pizza, pork belly fries, and a cheese board. The pizza was really saucy/spicy, but still really good. The cheese board was amazing and the meats and cheeses were so fresh and the price was good for the amount of food it came with. The fries were really cheesy and had a good amount of pork. Over all, we had a good experience and I'll defiantly come back!"
"Bucks County, PA",3/6/2017,4.0,"Nice place for a mid range lunch. The beer selection is outstanding. The menu hasn't changed much in the past few years, so I don't go all that often. But what they serve is quite well executed. Today I got the chicken and greens salad which had poached pesto chicken, chick peas, arugula, English cucumber, celery, haricot verts, heirloom cherry tomatoes, shaved parmesan, and a roasted tomato vinaigrette. Very competent salad with lots of 'stuff'. A pleasure to eat. I also got the buffalo and blue cheese cauliflower which is my absolute favorite here. It's spicy, rich and delicious. Theres no better way to eat cauliflower in my opinion. My chick went with the mushroom and truffle ricotta creme pizza which she fully enjoyed. The size was huge too, plenty for 2 people to share. Check out the vault next time you're in the neighborhood. You'll definitely be treated to some great food and beer."
"Philadelphia, PA",3/8/2018,4.0,"Dude! Okay, for starters, Downtown Yardley is cute as. As close as it is to where I live, I honestly can't believe I've never ventured to this adorable main street. Fortunately, a date led me here, and I was so thrilled with his choice! Craft beer is my newest indulgence, and Vault offers a simple, but varied menu of brews. We tried the Trial and Error, which sort of like a flight, is three 3oz. samples of the same beer: one cask, one draft, one nitro. (The draft was my favorite!) The set-up is awesome. True to it's name, Vault is an old bank, maintaining some original architecture and even the doors to the old vault. It's a great dim-lit venue, perfect for drinks, a romantic dinner, or a nice night out. Given it being a Tuesday night before a major nor'easter, it was pretty hopping. Parking was a bit tricky. There's some free street parking nearby, and couple of hidden parking lots (though I'm unsure if you're really able to use them). This is a gem of a place! I'm super keen to come back and try the food!"
"Cambridge, MA",4/7/2018,5.0,"Came here for brunch and I am a huge fan! We ordered a pizza with sausage, onion, and peppers, a pretzel braid, and tomato soup. I ordered the stout, which had a full flavor, and then bought a four-pack of the mosaic IPA to bring home. I liked that one even more - it was flavorful and the cans were so stylish. For the food, the pretzel was so soft and doughy - just what I wanted. We dipped it in the tomato soup, which was perfectly seasoned. The pizza was nice and crispy on the bottom and covered generously with toppings. We ended up saving one slice to bring home and I was grateful to be able to enjoy the taste again later on that day. The restaurant itself is well-lit with plenty of windows to let in the natural light. It has multiple sections for seating. We were placed in front of the door to a vault, which was very cool! We saw employees going in to store beer. All in all, would come back again!"
"Philadelphia, PA",6/11/2019,2.0,"Service mediocre, beer ok, food below mediocre. Never have I had to return two pizzas for being raw on the inside. Should've returned the third one still raw. All the pizzas and sandwich were blah. No seasoning or flavor. Especially the brisket, over cooked an no flavor. Server disappeared for 40 minutes and could order more drinks or food. Atmosphere was nice but a little too crowded outside. Beer 3 of the IPA have little to differentiate themselves. Basically the same hop base and even the menu has the same description. The stout was good thought. Overall underwhelming and wished we'd never gone....."
"Levittown, PA",5/24/2019,2.0,"I had wanted to try this place for a few years, finally got there and I have to say I was overwhelmingly under impressed. The atmosphere was very cramped and not very memorable. The food was okay, but nothing worth the price they tote for anything. The service was slow and the servers were very inattentive. Very disappointed."
"Newtown, PA",11/4/2018,2.0,"Went there on a date this week. The food presentation has fallen off. The red wine was chilled. We sat outside and it was windy. When a gust of wind blew away the wine (it spilled due to the gust) they didn't even offer to refill the glasses. The pizza wasn't crispy, but a bit soggy.Not going back, but I hope they get their act together."
"Princeton, NJ",11/28/2018,5.0,I LOVE the Vault. Super neat place since it was a bank before. Their beer is awesome as is the atmosphere. Service is professional. I love their Cheese board. It's HUGE!
"Morrisville, PA",7/4/2019,5.0,Love there brick oven pizza. Plus if you sit outside on a Saturday you have perfect seats for music on main.
"Central Jersey, NJ",1/13/2018,4.0,"Former bank that was renovated into a trendy, hip and casual restaurant that serves craft beer and excellent twist on your beloved favorites. We started off with beer. I had the Blonde, hubby had the Mosaic, The Kid ordered breakfast stout. All three were excellent but you could drink the breakfast beer as a stand alone. My beer paired best with the Wild Mushroom pizza. The mushroom pie was flavorful and you can truly taste the garlic truffle ricotta and parmesan. Hubby's beer paired better with our other pizza, Brown Sugar Buffalo which had fresh mozzarella and honeyed prosciutto and onions. Finally we also had incredible crab cake sliders. They were exceedingly generous with the portions of their food. Tonight we were serenaded by a jazz trio. It was a live jazz group that sang as they played their musical instruments. Chill atmosphere where they took an austere bank and warmed it up with Victorian looking lighting's hanging from the ceiling and did I mention their wine rack?! The converted the private side rooms where you use the take your safe deposit box into posh looking bathrooms. Ingenious. Our waitress Emily was wonderful. She was always on top of taking care of everything. Her warm personality made us feel comfortable and welcomed.  She never rushed us and always had a smile no matter how busy it got. My only tip is the order the mushroom pizza first before ordering any other pizza with the exception of the margarita pizza. The rest of their pizzas are bold bursting with flavor. We will definitely come back again."
"Piscataway, NJ",4/30/2019,4.0,"This micro-brewery has a classic and elegant style inside a uniquely, remodeled bank building. The waitress was very friendly and had a good sense of humor. We had duck pizza which was excellent along with a Cuban sandwich. The food, service and beer were all good."
"Raleigh, NC",1/5/2019,5.0,"Duck and apple pizza: 9/10 would recommend. It was so incredibly delicious.All the brews seemed good but the Chaotic IPA I tried with my father was delicious and smooth. For a 9% specialty brew, they did a great job making it still a nice beer to take down and not tough. The ambiance is very nice and I would definitely return. I'm sure all the other pizzas are delicious too but get the duck and apple if in doubt."
"Trenton, NJ",5/21/2019,4.0,Extraordinary lager and incredible sustenance. It's an agreeable spot to hang at the bar and make the most of your nourishment and beverages.
"Langhorne, PA",1/24/2020,5.0,I live nearby and don't come here enough. I try to bring business colleagues here to bring in more people and share a more relaxing and unique dinner than  just going to a chain.
"New York, NY",6/24/2019,5.0,The service was great!Drinks- The drinks on draft are strong and well worth itAppetizers - Braided Pretzel with the beer cheese ( a must)- Buffalo cauliflower with bleu cheese was fantasticEntrees- Cheesesteak pizza- Burger. Get the red pepper aioli on the side as it's pretty strong. Little bit goes a long way)Love the place and will return.
"Morrisville, PA",3/1/2019,2.0,"Usually very crowded.Price wise not cost effective.One time, they served wine in a cracked glass. When informed showed no remorse, responsibility or courtesy. Stopped going to Vault Brewing after the last experience.Drgreesh"
"Bullhead City, AZ",8/28/2019,3.0,"Went there for lunch had the Duck pizza and my friend had the brisket sandwich.  Both dishes were very mediocre and way too salty.  The beer could have been better, for this is a brewery after all."
"Princeton, NJ",3/4/2018,5.0,"We continued our post run treat-fest with a stop at Vault Brewing. I've been wanting to check this place out and was blown away by the quality of both their beers and food! Vault is located downtown in a pretty stone building. Since we came at noon on a Sunday, it was pretty calm, but it seems like it gets poppin later at night. I had the blonde while my friend enjoyed the breakfast stout. I have never had a stout that I liked before- this one is delicious!! It has a nice coffee flavor with hints of maple syrup. We split the brisket sandwich which was delicious! Everything was so good that we couldn't leave without a 4 pack of the breakfast stout!"
"Lafayette Hill, PA",12/23/2017,5.0,"Stopped in here for lunch with my coworker and manager, and it was a really good time! The feel of the restaurant is pretty casual, and they have a bunch of high-top tables around. We sat at one of those tables and each started with a beer flight. All the beers I tried were great, even though they included types I don't usually love, such as stout.For food, we ordered pork belly fries for an appetizer to share, and that was tasty. It came with two sauces to dip in, and everything tasted wonderful, especially with beer. As a main course, I ordered the banh mi burger, which is grass-fed beef served medium with some Asian flavors in the mix. The burger was nice and juicy, and the slaw that came with it added a nice fresh taste to it.I'm a fan and would like to check it out again in the future!"
"Trenton, NJ",11/20/2017,3.0,"Vault Brewing is A-OK place to go if you are looking for a casual dining and drinking experience with unique beers and good American food. Their pizzas are a high point on their menu, I highly recommend the Buffalo brown sugar  pizza...the brown sugar is clutch in making this an addicting treat. I ate the whole thing and I'm not even embarrassed about it, it was just too good to stop. The rest of the food was good, not amazing, but enjoyable. The Buffalo chicken salad was typical, the chicken a little over cooked and chewy. The peanut butter s'mores for dessert had major potential but the graham crackers were just slightly burned, which left a bitter taste in my mouth and overwhelmed what would've been a delicious combo of chocolate, marshmallow, and peanut butter.As for the drinks, we tried the wild berry sangria and the Philly Armada beer. The sangria was good, although I prefer mine to be a bit sweeter. The Philly Armada was a real treat and I'm not even a beer fan. The citrus notes in it were unique.All in all, the food gets a 4/5. The service however is another story. Our waiter was really attentive and cool, until he wanted us to leave to give up the table (we were there on a Thursday night, it was nowheres near jammed packed). We were there for about two hours in total which included dinner. The guys ordered a few beers throughout the meal and after and we stayed snacking on the appetizer we didn't finish and the dessert that I ordered. We were asked MULTIPLE times if we were ready to leave or if we wanted our check. I get that a new table equals more tips but we spent about $150 total so it's not like we were sipping water and chatting for hours on end. Definitely didn't appreciate the feeling of being rushed out door."
"Pottstown, PA",10/8/2018,4.0,"As I am working my way thru the philly.com list of best local breweries, I arrived at Vault Brewing.  It is a bit of driving from the city to get to Yardley and parking is a bit tight in the suburb but worth the effort.  There is a mixture of tables and bar tops and a small bar area.  There are only 6 beers on tap but I was happy with everything except the sweet potato ale.  Just not my taste.  I am sure there are those who will swear by it.  I had an awesome grilled cheese sandwich made with waffles and the menu is pretty extensive with several specials.  I wouldn't make an hour long drive to come again but would definitely stop by if I was in the area."
"Leesburg, VA",12/12/2016,5.0,"This is everything you want in a craft brewery and restaurant. The beers are excellent. With the exception of the sweet potato ale, which is too sweet for me, I liked them all. The standout is the robust porter. I get toast, chocolate and bit of smoke out of it. It's 5.4% ABV and goes well with most of the food options.The menu really stands out for a brew pub. Many great dishes, but here are the top items from my perspective:1. Anything with their house made pita or pizza dough. Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside with just the right amount of saltiness.2. The Chicken & Greens. Huge salad with killer pesto chicken, arugula, and an outstanding roasted tomato vinaigrette.3.  The chili. No beans. Instead it is ground beef, poblano, red bell peper, onion, buffalo sauce, sour cream, and chive. Rocks with any of their beers, but I like it the most with their IPA.Service has always been good. Been there five times now. Prices are reasonable given the quality. Love the atmosphere."
"Center City, Philadelphia, PA",10/22/2017,5.0,"The video at this link: vimeo.com/64247115 explains the excellent experience at the GastroPub. Seasonal menu with equal space for the food and Brews, elegantly yet simply presented. The decor is such that if you came in with nothing to talk about it could provide conversation for your entire visit. However, the philosophy and ambience encourages utilizing all your senses to enhance the brews and culinary adventure the company your with and the overall experience. We did not partake of the brews tonight but seriously look forward to going back and indulging, the selection was seasonal and sounded very good. Other rotating favorites of beer were available. We were served chilled water in impeccably clean glasses that were kept full during our visit. A bus person removed the one glass most likely not realizing it was one of our primary beverages. The wait staff stayed on top of pre bussing and supplying appropriate clean new utensils for each course. We enjoyed Roasted Butternut Squash Bisque, this was amazing, the presentation was perfect with a delicious creme fraiche decorative garnish, the texture was spot on served comfortably hot, it had a seasonal delight of flavors that danced on your tongue including a delightful dash of fresh paprika, and a pleasing natural sweetness, not going to lie, I finished every bit of this but a small taste and loved every bit. I am glad this was my starter  because it set the motion for this perfect meal. Next we had Pork Belly Fries, presented again exquisitely a very generous portion of wood fired fingerlings that tasted great alone, later to read on the menu cooked with duck fat so that explains their intense flavor. these were topped with a nice amount of fire roasted pork and fresh mozzarella. The plate was framed with both tasty garnish of what the menu identified as containing ""chimichurri and paprika- garlic aiolis both complimented the platters taste in very different ways, the first with a mild pleasant heat that was present at the finish and and stayed a bit, perfect to enhance a good brew and encourage a few. Next we enjoyed the Cuban Panini, reducing bread intake this would have been a stand alone healthy lunch or dinner selection. The ingredients were fresh and had good taste, I was not able to taste the ground mustard so a bit dryer then my preference and couldn't taste the dill pickle not sure was it inside the sandwich but the pork flavor and swiss cheese were very flavorful. Choice of sides were fresh cut house made Sweet Potato Chips or a house salad and that was a nice variety of greens with fresh cut carrot and a nice vinaigrette. Our next item was the Crab Cake Sliders, served on the best fresh buttery tasting rolls generous crab and full of flavor, these again had the choice of salad or the house made sweet potato chips so we sampled the chips. The were really good, fresh cut sweet potato cooked in a manner that was as crisp as deep fried but no oily feel or overwhelming flavor so the natural deliciousness of the sweets came thru perfectly. We finished tonight with two desserts the Black & White a very decadent chocolate mousse, chocolate cracker and vanilla custard with a perfect portion again detail was given to every texture and if the rest of the meals seasonal flavor didn't hit you yet it did with this. We also enjoyed the Bread Pudding, it tasted like a sweet bread was used possible with cinnamon was delightful and not smothered in syrups or but garnished with that nice chocolate mousse. Menu called for strawberries but they were not present, the desserts were 5 Star all on their own. Our server was Sarah C, she was pleasant and excited to explain the history of the name, encouraged walking into the other areas from the new bar in the rear with lighting fixtures with character and elegance that was still very cozy and casual, although closed during our Sunday evening visit it did encourage a warm visit and she suggested seeing the actual remaining bank vault pieces in the dining room all the way to your right when you enter in the front door on Main Street thru a replicated old bank type vault. Straight ahead from the entrance is the brew area and a cozy bar area, we sat in a small room near the impressive wood fired oven in a high top bar type table that would have been fine had we not sampled a number of plates per course. There were no salt or pepper on the table and not needed with the nicely seasoned food. Total bill $68.05 + a well earned gratuity.The leftover containers were a plain cardboard recyclable product ++.There is no Liquor but something from the brew menu that will satisfy most palates. Parking is available nearby and not an inconvenience, website suggests in the rear of the Vault or across the street in the public parking lot at Buttonwood Park.Thanks Colin M. and George B. for highly suggesting a visit to the Vault!"
"Langhorne, PA",2/18/2018,4.0,"A real nice micro brewery right in town. They have very good beer selections and we had a couple of drafts. We got a duck pizza to split, which was wonderful. The place was busy but not crowded. It was about 4pm on a Saturday.There were servers everywhere and it is likely the table service was fine. We sat at the bar, which we prefer to do. The bartender was pleasant enough. We had not been here in awhile and noted that the entire back side of the place has been re done with a bar and seating area for live music. We will certainly be back to check that scene out soon.Mark & Nancy."
"Monroe Township, NJ",12/19/2016,5.0,"This is a cute place along the main street at Yardley. They have so much of their own on draught, along with lots of wine. They keep on changing the brew almost every month so do check out the current selection before you visit them. If you don't know what to order, they have a list of specialty cocktails they have put together. The ambiance is a little dark and broken out in different rooms, but bright enough to see what you are drinking. We tried buffalo cauliflower for an appetizer and pizza to share.We got there around 6:30pm on Sunday night and place was packed. We had to wait about 25 minutes for us to get seated. We waited at the bar and ordered the flight of seasonal craft beers to try on. The service was good. Over all atmosphere was good as well; they had the old bank vault doors, wine displayed in a wall by dining room, the safety-deposit boxes as you walked in- very cool to see architecture like that after a long time.They have merchandise you can buy, t shirts, growlers and what not as well as every painting on the walls are for sale. Personally, I thought they were very overpriced but I know nothing about paintings and art they had up there. The service was pleasant and friendly. Would return when in the area!!"
"New Hope, PA",10/5/2019,4.0,Good food good beer always crowded. I've had most items in the menu and all were very good. This is a great place to meet friends and socialize.
"Grapevine, TX",12/1/2019,3.0,"The Vault and the hip vibe it offers is something that was sorely missing in the Yardley area. While the Vault has been wildly successful with the hipster crowd, it seems like it's been resting on its laurels lately. The food is consistently great but the menu does not change that often and the selection fairly limited especially appetizers. The atmosphere in lively but on the weekends can be too loud to be enjoyed for long. Good luck trying to carry on a conversation if there is live music. The beer is good and many selections local or brewed on site but not a tremendous selection recently or rotation throughout the year.  Parking continues to be a challenge. Be prepared to park a few blocks away and walk on the weekends."
"Bordentown, NJ",11/24/2017,5.0,"I absolutely think this place is awesome! What's not to like ?? Good beers and good food... yes please! I liked the atmosphere and how dim the lighting is. It does make for a good night out with friends. It is a bit noisy but nothing too unbearable. I did a flight of Philly IPA, Harvest IPA, and Belgium Blonde. They were all really good. I would recommend the pork belly fries.. OMG!! I also had a duck and apple pizza with bacon and mozzarella. Wow!!!! I can't wait to come back !"
"Langhorne, PA",5/26/2019,4.0,Local brewery with live music and wood oven brick pretzel and pizza! Yum yum yum! Yardley hidden gem!
"Boston, MA",9/2/2018,1.0,"The Vault looks very inviting as you first walk in, clearly an inspiring  renovation occurred here enabling a modern feel while retaining a certain colonial charm. They truly have a wonderful selection of drinks- their own Belgian style quad was fantastic.The problem I ran into here was the hideous service. I first went to the bar to order a couple of drinks. I must say, the staff at the bar seemed very professional. The trouble started when my 89 year old mother came to join me and said she didn't think she would be comfortable sitting on one of  the barstools with no back. We moved over to one of the four unoccupied table tops near the bar. One of the hostesses came over and asked us if we were eating. We said we weren't sure and were then told that we couldn't sit at one of the tables unless we were ordering food, their policy, blah blah blah, and were asked to take our drinks outside.Ok, no problem I guess, we went outside and there was nowhere to sit down. We walked around with our drinks for a couple of minutes, walked through the deck area and came back into the building on the other side and sat at the only small, unoccupied table we could find. A young dark haired server came over and asked us if we were ready to order, when she saw we had no menus, she threw her arms up, immediately came back to the table with the menus which she dumped on the table and then stormed over to the hostess stand to tell off the kids that were working there. One of the young hostesses came over to the table and again apologized for the policy, etc, etc, but next time please dont just sit at a table, blah blah. So about three minutes later, the angry young server came over and asked us if we were ready to order. My mom very politely said she didn't think she was hungry yet. This snot faced brat snatched the menus out of our hands, pulled a hostile face, stalked off and then went and got in every other employee's ear within fifty yards to complain about us. Whatever, we finished our drinks.They were good. My mom really liked the Berry Sangria. Some other guy came over and asked us if we wanted anything else, before I finished telling him I had started a tab at the bar, he was off looking for our check in the rear restaurant area, which- guess what? Set the waitress off on yet another tirade.Its too bad, we liked the place, but in my view the hostess stand and restaurant area needs some adult supervision, or at the very least for someone to explain to them that its not all about them and how many tables they can turn. Have some respect for your customers, especially the ones that are seventy years your senior. We just wanted to enjoy a drink or two, we didn't need the astonishingly bad attitude."
"Morrisville, PA",3/26/2019,4.0,"Beer.  Now, hear it in Homer Simpson's voice...Beerrrrr!  And lots of beer. All made in-house. Always good choices. The food menu continues to improve with more diversity over time and the beer menu features a few ""safe"" choices for the novice while letting more ambitious beer drinkers try something new."
"Philadelphia, PA",8/12/2018,3.0,"I'm a sucker for a craft brewery in a unique spot, so this converted bank seemed right up my alley.The canned Vault beers I've had from the bottle shop have all been great, but the pub experience here was a bit lacking.The space has an overall gloom that was highlighted by a server griping to the bartender within ear shot of patrons that another server was ""stealing her tables.""Girl, I feel you, but you've got to keep that isht in the back room.I didn't have food, though pizza and other pub options looked and smelled good. Maybe next time."
"Worcester, MA",8/9/2018,2.0,"Upon looking at the Yelp review, it seemed like a great place. We get there and the hostess was indifferent about our arrival. She didn't say hi or ask us about our seating- just stared at us. No high chairs and definitely not kid friendly (my mistake for not reading the stats fully). The beet salad was yum, but the brisket sandwich relied too much on the cheese for flavor. I don't eat cheese with meat, so the sandwich had virtually no flavor, even with a sauce! The Cuban sandwich was OK, but too Americanized (according to my husband). The waitress rarely came to our table, and it was mad dark.We were hoping for a sweet new joint but really bummed by the ambience and staff."
"Philadelphia, PA",6/13/2019,5.0,"Best happy hour around! The space is one of a kind, food and beer are always fantastic. Even if you're not a beer fan they have a great wine selection and a few cocktails to choose from. Our go to spot when anyone is visiting from out of town."
"Trenton, NJ",2/6/2019,4.0,"Another cute place in Yardley, a former bank hence the name. it's got that small town local feel to it. When I walked in the first time 2 years ago half of the men were dressed in plaid. It's very laid back, but the food is excellent, I got the sugar bacon pizza. There's a ton of selections for craft beer, so definitely stop in, and try this place out."
"Ewing Township, NJ",5/28/2019,4.0,This place has a great atmosphere and cool vibe. Definitely a fun night out. Four stars because it was very crowded and had a long wait. Not much seating if you are just at the bar (but that's because it is so popular!) Better for a smaller group or two people.
"Marlboro Township, NJ",5/18/2019,2.0,"Was disappointed with the food. The burger was overpriced and the presentation was a disaster. No food should come out looking like the burger did. Sloppy, small and no char or grill marks. There was no flavor and it looked like burger was boiled. The service was good and beer was tasty. The restaurant is attractive but dark. They need to up the ante with their food and lower their prices."
"Morrisville, PA",5/17/2019,5.0,Always good. Excellent beers and varied menu. Nice atmosphere and attentive wait staff. Never disappointed
"Monmouth Junction, NJ",7/1/2018,3.0,The good:Nice building.   The beer was very good.  Staff is nice.Bad:Pork belly fries have almost no pork.  Way over priced for cheese covered fries
"Lynbrook, NY",6/3/2018,5.0,"I went here last night and it was really wonderful. I sat at the bar as I was alone and find they to be most comfortable in those situations. 1. They had a jazz trio there playing music that really set a chill relaxed vibe and enhanced the ambiance.2. The beers are really excellent. I say that as someone who regularly visits breweries, has known people in the brewing industry, and makes a point of trying beers. I literally got a flight of all six beers they had, and I can honestly say there wasn't one that I disliked, which is extremely rare for me. Their beers were very well balanced.3. I didn't get to have dinner there, but I did try their bourbon creme brulee. The crack was perfect. The custard pairs extremely well with their coffee stout. It was delicious.4. If you're a collector of glassware, their glasses are classy just like the location. I purchased their five year anniversary glass which has a unique shape and gold lettering. But honestly their other glasses are also beautiful. I was so enamored by their matt black, metal, cantine style growler that I even got a growler to go.Aside from all that was wonderful about the place, the staff was extremely friendly. The owner even commented on how calm I seemed (I was knitting as I do when I'm in a bar by myself). He seemed like a really nice guy, even made a point of saying goodbye before he left. Just really kind people who have a reached a kind of flow in their work with each other, and still have a good sense of humor when communicating with each other which I observed multiple times.I don't live in the area, but I would happily make the trip to come back here. I highly recommend a visit, and I recommend going with an open mind and a focus on experiencing the place."
"New York, NY",4/20/2018,4.0,"I really like this place. Sometimes the wait is too long, and the Yelp app that lets you reserve your place in line doesn't work all the time, but overall it's a great place to drink beers and drink pub food.Their grilled cheese is pretty incredible--especially when you add the avo into the mix. Their pizzas are good, though the kids cheese pizza is a bit cheese heavy.The sandwiches are great, and they make this seriously killer bread and pizza crust from scratch.The beer selection is pretty solid, though they do play it safe a bit. Mosaic is just purely classic, and there are a half dozen other beers you can easily drink all day long.The whole ambiance of Vault is cool--it's a nice place to just hang out. Just watch out on a Saturday or Friday night where this place is just banging. The live music is good--just make sure your table isn't too close to where the band plays.The back room works great for private events!"
"Bordentown, NJ",6/17/2018,5.0,"Loved this upscale, chic brewery I recently tried out for a friends' birthday!  On a Saturday night, it did get pretty crowded and there was a wait.  The rest of our party got there before us so they waited at the bar for our table to be ready.  The menu has some fantastic beer options and unique choices for food!  We were with a party of 9 so we ordered a bunch of small plates and shared!  I went with the duck and apple pizza, which had the perfect combination of flavors.  With duck confit, bacon, caramelized onions, apples, bleu and feta cheeses, and honey, it was a really unique option.  I also got to taste some of the pork belly fries and hummus!  These are great for sharing with others and are big enough for an entire meal.  The food also came out super speedy.As for the drinks, I was super stoked to taste some of their beers.  I started with the Orange Drip IPA and it was awesome!  I love IPAs but I also love fruity beers, and this was the perfect combination of both!  Styled after a creamsicle, it was orangey and sweet, but also hoppy at the same time.  I would highly recommend this one!  I also had the Modern Muse Pale Ale and I was pleasantly surprised at this one.  It was a hop-forward pale ale so it wasn't too overbearing, and still has some fruity flavors!  I was extremely impressed by the flavors of the beers and the variety of food options.  I will definitely tell my friends about this place and come back soon!"
"Ewing Township, NJ",7/7/2019,5.0,"We've had a wonderful experience every time we go! The patio seating is comfy, seating by the vault is interesting, and seating by the bar is best left to couples. There are also hi top tables downstairs that are nice for groups. The menu is eclectic and tasty. Their pizzas can't be beat. Brown sugar buffalo and wild mushroom are our favorites, as are the pork belly fries. The beer is Delicious and interesting. My kids love the s'mores dessert they offer. A true gem!"
"Morristown, NJ",7/18/2016,5.0,"Of course when we saw that a brewery was on the way to our final destination we had to make a plan for a lunchtime pit stop.  I will say that even if this was not a brewery I would be returning because the food was just that good.  The three of us took a seat without a wait, at the bar, during lunchtime on a Saturday.  We all sampled each others beers as we waited for our food order and the beer was very good.  I really liked that the fermentation vats were unhidden right behind the bar.  The building is an old bank so it is already very cool looking inside and out but the exposed vats gave it an industrial look that I was feeling.  The bartender was nice and the food came out promptly.  I ordered a pizza which could have definitely have been shared but the weekends are for indulging, right?"
"Levittown, PA",8/22/2019,5.0,The Vault has great food and the flights are terrific! Set in a town that has so many shops it makes a great place to visit.
"Columbus, OH",10/8/2019,5.0,Great atmosphere!  Bear Hug Oatmeal Stout is great!! Had there Brioche bread pudding! So good with the Bear Hug Stout! Great service.
"South Brunswick Township, NJ",3/12/2019,5.0,"Ummmmmm.......yum! We have the sausage pizza and the brown sugar pizza. Both were amazing! When we got there on Saturday night, it was packed and we had to stand and wait for a while, but we didn't mind. We tried some great beers and finished it off with Pizza that we took home and ate for the next two days! Staff was friendly and attentive. Will definitely go back again!"
"Piscataway Township, NJ",4/6/2019,5.0,This is my favorite place for Saturday dinner with family.  They have a good collection of brews and rotate them frequently . My favourite is the 5 C's IPA and of hops and clouds. My son loves their pizzas . Overall a great place with tasty food and good suds. Service is top notch as well. Hence the 5 stars !!!!
"Brick, NJ",2/9/2018,5.0,"Dining a Vault Brewing in the heart of downtown Yardley, PA introduces you to a new definition of taste. If you are in the mood for a cold beer on tap, you can SEE the beer being made in FULL VIEW right behind the bar. The kitchen, with it's wood fire oven is also in plain sight, and as you bite into your grass fed burger or wood fired pizza, you can see and taste the warmth, flavor, and scent that floats out of that oven. As you look around the space, you see iron fencing, high ceilings, and even an original bank vault door from the late ninetieth century now used as the entrance to the beer cellar. That said, Vault Brewing is a unique dining experience...where everything from the sites and smells all come together to really alter your taste buds, in a really cool and fun way! Introductory details: Vault Brewing dates back to 1889, where it once served the citizens of Yardley as their National Bank. It was the home of Bank of America until 2009. Then In 2012, the Cain Family transformed the old bank into a brewery and restaurant... and the magic began!!! I feel privileged to have had the experience to dine at Vault Brewing with my mom just the other day for the first time. I knew I was going to be in the area ahead of time, and messaged a very reliable yelp elite Gerald S who knows the area well and recommended the Vault! THANK YOU Gerald, your recommendation did not disappoint! The DRINKS:I'm not a huge drinker, but when in Rome, well... you know :)  I prefer dark beers, but I didn't want anything too strong since it was lunch time. I ended up ordering the Weizenbock, which is a dark wheat ale with hints of cherry, figs, plums, and toffee. It was a great choice for not having a beer in hmmm.... a year??? hahah!!! It SO hit the spot! Very flavorful!My mom loves beer and ordered the Belma Blonde ASAP. It's a Session Ale with a lot of hops and with a very citrus taste. It actually tasted a lot like grapefruit in my opinion (mom and I shared sips of each other's drinks). But if you like citrus, this beer was BURSTING with flavor! And yes, we saw the beer flowing right from the brewing itself, to the tap, to the glass! haha! The process was in plain site! Water was given to us without asking, which is a huge plus. H20 is very important! I like it went restaurants provide you with a glass as soon as you sit down. THE FOOD:The food here did not disappoint and the prices were very reasonable. We had such a hard time deciding what we wanted because everything looked good! My mom ended up getting the grass fed burger with a side house salad, and I got the crab cake sliders with a house salad. Both were excellent.  The crab cakes were not too fishy but still had that real crab cake taste. The burger, my mom said, was cooked just right. I do think that the bread on the crab cakes was a bit TOO big, for a I had to take off one of the buns because my mouth is just too tiny. LOL! Plus, I'm not supposed to eat bread (shame on me!) for health purposes, but I just decided to splurge! So worth it! SERVICE/ATMOSPHEREService was fantastic. The hostess who seated us was friendly and upbeat. Our server was informative, professional, and full of smiles the entire time. I also have to say, the other customers were fantastic! My mom and I dined the day of the Eagles Super Bowl Parade. We are both fans, but could not attend the parade because I had a doctor's appointment. But this place was truly a birds NEST for the customers were coming in complete eagles gear as the day went on! A lovely family sat next too us and we engaged in some great conversation with them. The family showed us pictures from the parade on their phones and close ups of the players... it was great! I love good food and good company. I'm also a die hard eagles fan and it was just so hmm REFRESHING to see so much GREEN in one spot! And, to be greeted with a smile instead of a snarl?!?! WHOA! I live in giants territory so I was just in my glory. Literally. Mom too :) Plus, the whole Vault concept really makes this place unique. The owners of the brewery kept just enough of the original bank in place so you know you are dining in a vault ;) It's really a cool and very unique experience.  I'll be back! And, if you aren't an eagles fan, don't worry, we dined on the day OF the parade, so I was eager to have conversation with fellow eagles fans. If you want to dine in peace, you most definitely have that option. I'm the one who likes to talk talk talk! hahah! I highly recommend this place and the next time I decide to splurge it is going to be on one of their big pizzas!!!"
"Cherry Hill, NJ",1/5/2019,4.0,"We stop here spur of the moment after going to Shady Brook Farms Light Show and I am glad we did. The space is really tight and we had to wait 45 minutes but it was worth it. Great atmosphere, used to be a bank and they kept a lot of the elements. The beer was very good, I had the Everything Is Going To Alright IPA and the Zing Pale Ale and would recommend both. We wanted to start with the Pork Belly Fries but they came after our Sausage Pizza. However they were worth the wait, they are a must get. Sausage pizza was good but not great. They do have a plain kids cheese pizza on the menu as well which we got for our son and he loved. Not in our usual stomping grounds but if we are ever back in the area we will be back."
"McLean, VA",7/24/2018,3.0,"Beer 5 stars, bar and food 3Had double ipa, bold and fresh. 2nd I had hop and harvest, a little light but crisp. The best in the area.Food I had pork belly sandwich. Was okay but not impressive. Meat was a little hard to chew. Bread was good. The sides, the chip is so small, I had to ask another; salad was small but good. Maybe the pizzas would have been better, but I didn't try that.Bar is good except the sign is small and a little hard to find, and bar has no TV. It pretty much guaranteed no one will come when there's big games. I left as fast as I can thinking about my sports to watch.Bottom line is, really good beer; perhaps not other things. Go there with friends, drink a little and go somewhere else."
"Bordentown Township, NJ",12/5/2018,5.0,Outside deck is great. Service and food are exceptional. A 5 star experience. Worth the trip.
"Bucks County, PA",5/5/2019,2.0,"Nick the waiter was great. However the food tonight was terrible.  The place used to be really good. The cauliflower lettuce wrap had no flavor. My aunts burger was underwhelming, sub par and not hot for $16.50. I'm used to paying similar price but for a great burger this was not that. The spinach artichoke pizza came out par cooked. Soggy, wet. The lemon ricotta overpowered the vegetables on the pie. The table next to us  ordered a mushroom pizza and the crust looked opposite of ours. Very crispy.  I don't know what's going on maybe the chef had the night off but that's no excuse. Consistency is key.  I don't know what else to say just disappointed. The servers were very nice about it and apologized but honestly it's not their fault. Oh and one other thing the hostess didn't smile and  seemed to not want to be there. When  my mom mentioned the soggy pizza on the way out she just shrugged. Weird."
"Jersey City, NJ",11/20/2018,5.0,"LOVE this place! They have stepped up their game seriously from the early years. My husband and I go there all the time... food is great, beer is great, service is great!"
"Oak Ridge, NC",11/4/2018,4.0,"Great brews and food in a former bank. We had the Italian sausage pizza which was light, fresh hot, with just the right balance of spice. Beers we had were the pale ale and stout both outstanding. Good service, great lunch"
"Seaside Heights, NJ",2/24/2019,5.0,"Great food, great beer. This is one of my favorite spots in Yardley. I enjoy the unique beer flavors and the food menu offers a creative variety of options. I have never had something that I didn't like. Some of my favorites include the chicken sandwich, waffle grilled cheese, buffalo cauliflower, and pretzel braid. The s'mores are perfect for dessert too."
"Newark, NJ",4/7/2018,5.0,What a great place from the minute we walked in we knew we were going to enjoy!  The beer is so nice loved the coffee stout and the buffalo cauliflower app was amazing as was the pork belly fries.  We look forward to a return with friends.
"Myrtle Beach, SC",8/19/2019,5.0,"Absolutely solid. Tried 2 beers...the IPA and the Pale and both were flavorful. My wife had an Old Fashioned from their pre-mix beverage selections and it was great. The awesome smells from the kitchen permiate the whole restaurant, and finally - the service could not have been friendlier. This was a perfect stop before heading to the airport for a bite (both the pretzel and the pork belly fingerling fries) were perfect and the beverages. Would ho out of my way to return."
"Fairless Hills, PA",11/21/2015,5.0,"My husband John is very traditional when it comes to pizza. He's a plain or pepperoni man. On our first visit to The Vault, I spotted a pizza topped with duck confit, gala apples, candied bacon, and blue cheese (no tomato sauce). This sounded heavenly to me, but I couldn't convince John to share one. (The menu at The Vault seems to beg for folks to come in parties of two or more, order several items, and share them.) Tonight, John was out of town and I was on my own, so I decided to head up to The Vault and order that duck and apple pizza. Wowee. It was every bit as awesome as anticipated, especially since it was prepared in a wood-fired oven. And hey, I have half of it in a take-away box for later! There was a brief wait for a table on Saturday at approximately 5:30, so I relaxed with an IPA. Once seated, service was quite swift and attentive. Looks like I waltzed in at a good time for a solo bite. The place was absolutely packed by the time I departed."
"Asbury Park, NJ",5/27/2019,5.0,"First time here and it was really good. They have a duck confit pizza that will blow away any pizza you compare it to anywhere. They have the whole local brew beer thing there so if you like local beers this place has some great ones. Parking can be hard sometimes around the place. There is a lot across the street, don't park there until you talk to the friendly older guy who is in charge of towing away cars from that lot. Just tell him you are going to the vault and he will say Park right there and you are good to go"
"Woodbridge Township, NJ",1/7/2017,2.0,"This was a YELP find.  We were in the area at Washington Crossing State Park and wanted to check out a local brewery and enjoy a drive along the river.  Score! Or so we thought...Located in a cute downtown with plenty of minicipal parking was The Vault brewpub.  Originally we were only stopping in for the beer but I thought the food looked amazing.  I would find out later that looks are deceiving.  For beer the husband had the Oatmeal Stout and I enjoyed the Sweet Potato Ale on nitro, both really good.  I had the Saison Noel to wrap things up and really liked that as well. The problem here is not the beer. It's everything else. After a wait we were finally seated. The place had emptied out a bit but our server still took a while to make his way over to us. We ordered our food and waited, and waited...  My burger was good enough but the minimal amount of overly salted sweet potato chips weren't worth it. They were actually recommended by our server (I was going to order the salad) and he said they were great. What came out were these stale overly salted practically inedible chips. I ate a few and couldn't torture myself to eat any more. Things really went south with the pizza though. The husband had the Margarita Pizza and hated it. I tried it to see how bad it was, and it was BAD. The sauce was watery and caused the cheese to slide off as he tried to eat it. They had to have added water to the sauce for some reason- probably to extend the use of the sauce. Maybe they were running out? I don't know, but I do know for $14, it was unacceptable for the pizza to be that gross and unedible. M would have complained and sent it back for something else, but the server never came back. We were really hungry at this point (after a 40 minute wait to be seated plus 20 minutes to get our food) so M tried to eat it. I think he stomached 2 pieces of this watery flavorless disgrace of a pizza before giving up in despair. M even had to get up to find us silverware and napkins, as the server forgot and since he never came back, we couldn't tell him.Our server never returned. I mean he became a total ghost. M finally flagged someone else for the check. At this point we just wanted to leave. This place has earned itself the newest spot on the duece list. The beer was great but the food and service was very disappointing.Skip it!"
"WSHNGTN XING, PA",3/5/2019,5.0,"Yardley is lucky to have this place. Outstanding fresh beer on tap, with a nice rotation of different styles of brews (IPAs, saisons, ports, stouts, etc.), outstanding tapas, and great decor and atmosphere. The outside deck is great in the spring and summer. They are even accommodating to dogs!  One of my favorites in Bucks."
"Plymouth Meeting, PA",12/10/2017,1.0,"Ugh, Vault...  You BLEW IT!  For a few years now, we've been going to shady brook farms for holiday lights and events.  Afterwars, we'd go to the Vault for some christmas Jazz music, food, and drink...   We went again this year, but brought a few friends with us.  They've never been there, but we told them it was our favorite microbrewery with great food.  When we arrived, we had an hour wait. It's a Friday night, so that is to be expected, no problem.  Eventually we were seated downstairs at a long table.  We couldn't hear the jazz music, but we would be able to hold some nice conversations.  We sat for about twenty minutes while the ""waiter"" made us wait.  He glanced at our table occasionally, but avoided coming over.  Eventually my wife went to the hostess stand and then magically he came over to us.  The ""waiter"" apologized and told us he didn't know people would be eating at that table, because no one has been eating there all day...  Hmm...  There was a ton of food, including and entire hamburger bun on the floor beneath our bench.  No one ate there today?  When was the last time you cleaned?  Also, if people were just drinking there and no one was waiting on them, why didn't this bar ask them politely to move, so they could turn a profit off of their tables?  It didn't add up, but we finally had ""service"".The menu we were given differed from the one upstairs.  We asked if they had the butternut squash soup and our ""waiter"" told us they did.  They didn't.  Ok, whatever.  Eventually, some food runners brought us our first two dishes.  Politely, the two people who received their food before everyone else waited to eat.  They did pick at their food a bit.  Suddenly the runner came back to our table and asked if we ate the food yet.  We said no, but we picked at it and ate some garnishes.  She said it was for a different table.  We all looked at each other and she reached in and took it away from us...   (side note, half of our table work/worked in the food industry, so whenever we go out to eat and people mess up, they all talk about it)...   They took our food and gave it to some other table...  You can't do that.  McDonald's won't even do that.  McDonald's also has classier staff than this place...  So I don't know.  We should have walked out then.  Oh, why didn't we just leave...  I wanted to, but everyone was hungry...  When we saw our food come down into the room, we made sure they didn't give it to someone else first...  The food was alright, but not at the temperature I would have expected mine.  Maybe it sat for a bit, who knows?  Our ""waiter"" comes back to see if we need anything else and eventually brings the check.  Ugh, almost everyone at our table wants to split the check.  I hate that...  Of course, ""waiter"" doesn't get it right, but who can blame him?  Service isn't really his specialty. From our car ride through Shady Brook Farms, I paid and everyone wanted to give me $6.  Since my check had someone elses money, they gave me some more to cover their food and the $6.  The other two then could just add $6 to their tip and I'd be slightly over 20%, but this place really didn't deserve it. I paid cash and told the ""waiter"" we were good, while everyone else used a card.  The ""waiter"" came back and handed me my change of just $2.00 even.  We were good and where was the cents?  Now I was mad, that this scumbag was most likely angry that I left him $2.53.  What was this passive agressive approach to giving me the $2.00?  I also hate when bartenders keep the coins for themselves.  I take that as a sign that they are tipping themselves.  He kept glaring at our table too.  I fought internally for a bit, but then realized, this guy didn't really do anything.  He didn't bring the food, all he did was bring over a drink for me personally.  I'll just tip him what he did for us.  He can have the $2.53.  Those horrible runners that gave our picked at food for people don't really deserve it either.  My tablemates could just pay me the $6 and we'll figure it out later.  The ""waiter"" did ask me about the $2 tip.  I called him out about the change and he was shocked that someone would care about the 53 cents.  I told him he tipped himself.  My wife was kind of mad that I didn't tell him it was because the service was horrible, but it really wasn't about that.  We've always tipped the proper amount, even when we had a bad waiter.  Hoping they would split it with the people that actually made the experience worthwhile.  Not this place.  We knew we were never coming back.  We even ordered food we had before and it tasted not as fresh.  Again, maybe sitting a bit...  It's sad too, because hopefully if there is a competent manager, those horrible people won't be there again when we return.  They don't belong in the service industry.  We just don't have a desire to ever return.  My advice to you, is if you want a beer, just go to the Jason Sudeikis looking bartender.  He has always been great."
"Cranbury, NJ",2/23/2019,5.0,What a nice place to grab a bite and beer. Everything on the menu is delicious and a nice selection on tap
"Princeton, NJ",10/17/2018,5.0,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and could not have pictured a better spot to go. This is literally one of my favorite brewing + food spots I've ever been to. The beers was EXCELLENT!!!! Got the sampler of Chaotic Neutral, Kuzcotopia IPA, Vital Signs and the Sweet Potato Ale. Wow so rich and flavorful. The darker Chaotic Neutral and Vital Signs was insanely good. Also ordered the Pretzel Braid starter with beer cheese and the Brown Sugar Buffalo pizza. The pretzel was amazing with the homemade beer cheese (no surprise there) and the pizza was the perfect thin crust and combo of hot sauce, cheese, meat and brown sugar (though I couldn't really taste the sugar). Had the best time just relaxing in their setup. Will absolutely be back!!!"
"Philadelphia, PA",12/27/2016,3.0,"The Vault. It used to be a bank. Now it's a brewery, hence the name. It's one of Yardley's prized gems. It's intriguing and everyone seems to speak highly of it, so I had to check it out. Food 3/5The food is subpar at best. The ingredients are cultivated locally from what I was told and the menu is concise but varied. That's not necessarily a bad thing however. And it's seasonal, like the brews they offer. I wasn't floored by the food to be perfectly honesty. It's fresh but dull. I had the burger and it was ""meh"". I've ordered the pizza before and it was good. But I honestly can't speak more on it. It's average at best. Where the food lacks, the brews will make up for it, any one of them is great. Service 5/5Whoever my server was, he did an amazing job. Super attentive and even though I took awhile to decide on what I wanted to eat, he made sure I was fully taken care of. I appreciated the patience and dedication. He even made an accommodation for the person I came with. What she wanted on the menu, wasn't there anymore but a variation of it did. But he had kitchen make it for her. I truly appreciate that as well. Ambience 4/5As I've mentioned earlier, it used to be a bank. It's a bit cramped inside and there is limited spacing but that's fine. It has this jazz feel to it, beautiful wooden floors, contemporary decor. You'll notice, there isn't any music being played or Tv's to watch. It's simply about you, the company you bring, and their food/service. I can appreciate that. All in all, if you're in the area and you want a great brew, stop by. The food is good, nothing exceptional or game changing, but you'll be satisfied. Call ahead though, it can get busy very quickly."
"Stony Brook, NY",10/6/2018,5.0,Great ambience. Went there twice. Definitely try their pizzas and beer samplers. They have an outside seating which is super nice.
"Yardley, PA",7/9/2019,5.0,Great beer and food.  Usually very crowded but that is because the beer and food is so good.  Not a place for a quiet meal.
"Philadelphia, PA",8/27/2018,4.0,"This is one of our go-to places in the area.  As a piece of advice, they do not take reservations and they are generally very busy, it is definitely a better place for a small party or date night/lunch. If you're a beer fan this small brewery really packs a punch! Try the flights to start - which are very generous - and pick your favorite.  They have a wider variety and all are delicious.  If you're not a beer fan they also offer very tasty cocktails! You can't go wrong with any of the food or pizzas.  My personal favorites are the harvest beets, pork belly fries, the brisket sandwich and the duck and apple pizza! The food ranges from somewhat adventurous to simple so every palate will be pleased! I've never had anything come out poorly done.  This place is also special thanks to its atmosphere.  Inside its almost like a speak-easy, very cool and laid back.  It's fun to be in the old bank! I can't recall which days they have it, but they also have live music some nights! There is also a small outdoor patio where you can sit when its nice, and you can bring your furry friends.  In sum, a wonderful, cool place to eat that is a little different from the rest of the places in the area!"
"Ewing Township, NJ",1/29/2019,4.0,The food is great! Our server was really good for about 50% of our visit!  The other 50% he was MIA. We had empty wine and water glasses for a majority of our dinner and would've enjoyed having something to drink!  The food came out pretty quick and was delivered by someone other than our server and we asked them for water refills and they told us that they were not our server.
"Hollywood, FL",12/29/2018,1.0,The rudest hostess staff I have ever encountered. Making fun of customers and putting friends in front of waiting guests. Not worth the wait and the obnoxious staff! I would never visit this awful establishment again
"Morrisville, PA",10/21/2018,5.0,Love the selection of beer and their pizza is out of this world. Had the duck pizza - outstanding ! Great at atmosphere and pretty good parking across the street.
"Yardley, PA",11/14/2017,3.0,"Always good but there is better.I think what the Vault has brought to the Yardley area is great but I do think this place is a bit overrated. The food is good but I repeat good, I am not overly impressed with what I have gotten there. With that said I haven't tried the entire menu and who knows there may be something on it that would surprise me."
"Ann Arbor, MI",9/16/2018,5.0,"Loved the brewery - really cool how they turned a bank into a brewery. You can see the actual vault, the tellers and the older checks that people wrote back in the day. Friendly and hip atmosphere. Loved the coriander sea salt beer - nice and refreshing for a hot summer night. Definitely try it if you're in the area!"
"Buffalo, NY",11/11/2016,5.0,"Friends from the area took us here and it was the best place to be on a Friday afternoon! The decor and environment was so welcoming while not being too busy. One waitress even let us see inside the actual ""vault"" in the dining room! It was so cool to learn about the history of the building while enjoying their beers. We loved their blonde beer the most and even bought a 1 liter growler to go. I would recommend this to anybody in the area!"
"Conshohocken, PA",12/9/2017,1.0,"Update:We came to Vault yesterday after seeing the Christmas lights at shadybrook farms, as it is becoming tradition to go to both places every Christmas season now. We were excited to come here again as the first couple times we had a great experience. We brought our friends along with us as well. We arrive and were told it was an hour wait. We said that's fine and we just hung out and drank at a table by the bar. We were supposed to get a text when our table was ready, but we didn't get any cell phone service here so my husband had to keep going outside with my phone to check if they texted us. The hostess said she would come get us when it was ready. An hour later it's ready and she leads us to a big table in the basement area of the restaurant. I was kind of disappointed because the main reason I came here was to listen to Christmas jazz music, and all you could hear in the basement was regular music. I didn't even  hear any Christmas jazz music while we were waiting upstairs for our table either, just regular jazz. I don't know if it was still too early in December or what, but I think they should be playing it after Thanksgiving. Anyway, so we're all sitting at our table and multiple servers had eye contact with us but no one came over to our table to take our order or at least check on us. After sitting there for 15-20 minutes I got annoyed and went to the hostess to tell her no one came to our table yet. I also said I would like a table upstairs to listen to the jazz. She said I would have to wait longer so I said no we already waited a long time. Eventually our waiter comes over and says sorry he didn't see us because no one was sitting there all night they don't normally use that table. That was a lie because there was food left on the ground from whoever ate there before us. I noticed the menu we got was different from the one upstairs. I wanted the butternut squash soup. It was listed on the menu we were looking at upstairs but ours downstairs said tomato bisque. We asked our waiter and he said they still had it. 10 minutes later he comes over to us and says there's no more butternut squash soup left they just ran out. My cousin and I were extremely disappointed. Well maybe if we got service faster we could have got it. The night keeps getting worse, the next thing that happened was very disturbing and gross. A food runner brings my pizza and my friend's grilled cheese out. We both poked at our food. A few minutes later someone comes back and said that wasn't our food, they got the wrong table. They asked if we touched it. We both said yes. My friend said she ate a carrot off the salad, and I touched my pizza trying to find the best slice. They took it away from us anyway and gave it to a table across from us. I work in food service and you are not allowed to re serve anything if it hits another table, whether they touched it or not. We both said we touched it and yet they still served it to another table. The logical thing to do would be just let us keep the food, and give the next table our order but I guess no one has common sense here. We are both getting over colds as well, so I guess the other table will catch our cold that we had. So that means the food that we ate could have been given to a different table as well, gross. Our food was decent overall. I asked for a Togo box but our waiter forgot it. We asked again and he brought it but didn't bother clearing my dinner plate. I had to try to eat dessert while trying not to get my shirt dirty from my pizza plate. The dessert I got was nasty, I got the black and white. It was a spiced custard with chocolate mousse. It had a bad mouthfeel to it, it was grainy and there was too much nutmeg in it. We each got separate checks. My husband and I were not satisfied with our service at all so we didn't leave a great tip. My husband gave him the money and said we didn't need change. Our waiter took  53 cents from us and gave us the remaining few dollars back, to hint that he wanted a bigger tip than that. He even confronted my husband about it as we were leaving. My husband said when places keep the change like that and use it towards their tip then that's what they get. He was a scumbag. I don't know what happened to this place. We were sad, because we loved going to this place before. My husband said this was one of his favorite microbreweries. Maybe they got new management. It seemed like a lack of communication and poor management/ discipline. We probably won't come back, maybe just for drinks but probably not. This place is 45 minutes away from us and parking is a pain too. We can probably just find other places closer to us."
"Newtown, PA",1/2/2018,4.0,"UnBELIEVABLE food and beer selection!!! My boyfriend and I ordered the buffalo cauliflower (amazing!!) to start, and then had their house burger and the Duck and Apple pizza - MUST try if you love duck because they did a fabulous job with it. The only reason I took off a star was because of how abysmal our server (Emma) was - she never came back for our check (another server had to help us leave because we were only out for lunch and left hanging for 30 minutes) and she was quite rude to us all afternoon. I'm a server, I get it - but we actually left without getting dessert and more beer, which we were planning on, because our waitress made us feel like we were a burden and very unwelcome. And... never came back to our table?Maybe just stick to the bar top!"
"Philadelphia, PA",11/6/2018,5.0,Coolest restaurant in the area. I think I go here too much. The menu is great. And the vaults are real.
"Richboro, PA",9/21/2018,3.0,Their beers are good and they have a nice selection. Everything we have gotten has tasted good but 2 times my husband and I both got mildly sick after eating here. We just left there after some beers and the hummus plate and the bell peppers were slimey! It's worth coming for a cool beer but I think the food quality is questionable (although tasty)
"Ewing Township, NJ",6/22/2018,4.0,The food here is absolutely amazing. The beer is really good too. Both are rather pricey though so I am not able to come very often. It really is delicious and quick service every single time. It's a treat to stop by.
"Moorestown, NJ",9/1/2018,4.0,More like 4 and a half stars. A top notch gastropub housed in an old bank vault. Good beer brewed on premises and even better food. The cauliflower bites with pickled celery was the best we've ever had and the hummus board was really good too.  The pizzas taste as good as they look. The only demerit was for a slightly salty fig and prosciutto salad. Looking forward to a return visit.
"Washington, DC",12/27/2017,5.0,This brewery is housed in a memorable building with a beautiful ceiling and the heavy old bank vaults lining the walls. There was ample room for a large group while still feeling intimate for a table of two. The beer was unremarkable but fun to try a flight as they only serve their own beers.
"Mt Laurel, NJ",4/11/2018,5.0,"We came here strictly for the beer and we weren't disappointed! Parking wasn't the easiest, but we were able to snag a spot in the back lot after a few times circling around the block. It was a Saturday afternoon and the inside was crowded. The hostess told us there was another bar downstairs where we might be able to find a seat instead of waiting for a table, so we ventured down and she was right. We ordered a flight of all 7 beers for $14.50 and enjoyed them all. The Mosaic Imperial IPA was our favorite. The Chinook Pale Ale was a close second which we wound up getting a crowler of to take home. I highly recommend both beers!The bartenders were friendly and attentive. The couple next to us had a delicious looking pizza and they said it was amazing. We'll be back next time we're in the neighborhood and will try their food."
"New Hope, PA",9/30/2016,4.0,"The beer is good. If you've never been, get a Sampler. That way you can try everything on tap. As for the food... I'm a big fan!The Buffalo Cauliflower is the BOMB dot com. I would pick these over wings, any day of the week. The pickled celery it's served with adds a nice sweet crunch. The Hummus Board Trio and the Antipasta Board are another great choice for an appetizer, especially to share with the table. The Hummus selection is always different which I love. And those Pork Belly Fries... order them because they are incredible.I have had their salads... the Kale & Couscous as well as the Buffalo Chicken. Both were fresh, flavorful and filling! The pizzas are great too. I have had the Margherita, the Wild Mushroom and the Italian Sausage. Between the Arugula and the Truffle on the Wild Mushroom, it is full of flavor. The Italian Sausage pizza had a nice spiciness to it. You can't go wrong with anything you order!Don't forget about dessert... my server suggested the Black and White. It's a Chocolate Mousse with a Vanilla Custard. I was not disappointed. Although the glass it was served in wasn't ideal in my opinion. Nonetheless it was delicious!Seasonal right now is the Sweet Potato Ale. My opinion is, it should be on tap 365 days a year. It's probably my favorite beer offered at Vault. Another seasonal must have is the Harvest Beet Salad. Beets over Frisee topped with Goat Cheese... how can you go wrong?"
"Langhorne, PA",10/6/2017,3.0,"not bad! this place is pretty cute, the vault door interiors are fun.  the food here is pretty good, we ordered the pork belly fries (MUST GET. potato wedges smothered in fat, with sliced pork belly, and fresh mozzarella melted on top, and paprika/buffalo parsley/garlic aioli on the side.  pretty good portion that you can share with 3 people. really filling) and the small portion of the antipasta board (DONT GET. don't really recommend it.  its just prosciutto, salami, mozzarella, and provolone cheese, and a couple olives. the spread isnt amazing. you can just make this at home. wish they provided a different variety of cheese than just a typical store bought mozzarella and provolone.  the cheese board would be more ideal, but the cheese on that board doesn't seem appealing either.  the pita bread that came out with is was pretty good. it was warm and huge portion for bread. you can fill yourself up with the bread from this board).beer - it was aite.  not the best beer ive ever had, but their chardonnay saison was pretty crisp and fresh.  ipa could be betterwine - the list is all local wine, but not worth to get a glass for a $15 bottle you can just get yourself.  BUT they give you a hefty pour in a huge glass which is nice.  the rose is a typical rose you would get at any pizza place too, more juicy and dark than a light rose.i would come here again to try the other food."
"Morrisville, PA",6/9/2019,4.0,"Good service and very high quality pizza ingredients, made with thought and care. Too bad their pretty bird coffee across the street doesn't match the care put into this restaurant."
"Sea Isle City, NJ",5/6/2019,4.0,"Was dying to go to a decent brewery on a nice Friday afternoon and came across Vault Brewing. Though we had about 3 different waitresses, things came to us pretty fast with our water, flights of beer and those amazing pork belly fries. We had ordered a pizza with our fries which never had came out even after we ordered more beers. After probably 45 minutes and our beers were done, we politely let one of our three waitresses know our pizza had never came but we were full and ready for our check. She left and came back with a free pizza to go (odd how there was ironically a pizza ready?) and our beers comped off. Though that had happened when it wasn't terribly busy, the comped check, awesome beers and amazing fries made up for the 45 min + wait for the pizza. Would definitely come back again!"
"Pittsburgh, PA",7/17/2016,4.0,"A lovely drive along the Delaware River near the Pennsylvania - New Jersey border led us to the beautiful small town of Yardley, PA.  It was here that we found Vault Brewing Co, or as my friend called it the entire drive, ""the Yardley Brewery.""  It's a beautiful building that used to be a bank.  That theme is incorporated into not just the interior design but also the name of the brewery itself.  How clever.We sat in the bar area at a high table between the bar and the kitchen.  We ordered a flight of 4 that included Opal Blonde, Hefeweizen, 5Cs IPA and Telemetry.  I enjoyed all the beers (maybe the IPA a little less) and then went for a full pint of Telemetry on nitro.  I have to admit, it was a beautiful sight.  We weren't necessarily hungry, but still ordered up some nachos (I believe they had pork belly on them) that went well with the beers.My only real concern was the bathrooms....downstairs.  That always makes me nervous after a few beers.Despite the fact that I now first refer to it as ""the Yardley Brewery"" before correcting myself, Vault Brewing made a positive impression with some fantastic beers and a cool atmosphere.  I would strongly recommend checking it out to see if it grabs your interest."
"Freehold, NJ",6/9/2017,4.0,"This place is well done. The atmosphere is great and I liked the eclectic mix of people. They brew their own beers and the two I tried had a nice mix of flavors. The menu was fresh and interesting. We started with the Buffalo cauliflower. It was very good. The staff is super pleasant and knew the menu items and beer well enough to answer all our questions. Additionally, the staff is a house pool so they really work as a cohesive group. I would have given a 5 except the parking situation isn't the best. We had trouble on a Thursday night at 8pm, I can only imagine what the weekend is like."
"Phoenix, AZ",11/1/2016,4.0,Pretty good beer.  The IPAs were very good.  The NZ style IPA was especially nice.  I didn't love the Sweet Potato Ale or the Pale.  For food I tried the Buffalo Brown Sugar pizza because where else am I going to get that?  It was good. Not too heavy on the buffalo and a nice crust.  It could have used more mozzerala though.  The service was great and you can tell this is a popular local spot.
"East Windsor, NJ",10/23/2019,1.0,"Had dinner here today with my boyfriend and our 4.5 month old. They were very accommodating with giving us a seat where it would be easy to have the baby in his carrier. The servers were very nice and attentive. Boyfriend ordered a flight and thought everything he tasted was awesome. I got water. When the waitress refilled my glass one time, she poured a dead fly out of the pitcher into it. Yak. The food came out very quickly, like too quick... weirdly fast. It was obviously heated up. I had the crab cake sliders and sweet potato creme brûlée. Both tasted excellent, but the creme brûlée was cold in the middle and hot on the edges, adding to why I thought they just microwaved it. Not long after we left, I started feeling odd. I definitely have food poisoning. My stomach is in one big, terribly painful cramp. If I wanted to feel like I'm in labor again, I would get pregnant again. No thanks."
"Johnson City, NY",7/2/2018,4.0,"First time checking this place out. In town for a visit and wanted to hit up a brewery type place and the Vault was recommended. Very cool place with many of the old bank features still present. Beer was decent, we wanted to eat dinner so we waited for a table and were seated rather quickly.  Ordered the buffalo Cauliflower and it was awesome. The pickled celery!! Wow I loved it! We split a pizza and got the Artichoke pizza which was very good. We would have stayed longer but the area we were seated in was near the kitchen and it was so freaking hot we just got the bill and left. Granted it's 95+ degrees outside but I thought it was too hot inside to even enjoy our meal. That was the only thing I didn't like about it--will have to go back when the weather is more agreeable and see if that helps at all."
"Yardley, PA",5/13/2019,4.0,"Ive been here 5 or 6 times. Very cool atmosphere, even cooler beer. One of the few, hard to find good spots in Yardley. A bit pricey, but worth it!"
"Langhorne, PA",1/6/2019,5.0,"Located on the Main Street of Yardley Pennsylvania, Vault Brewing Company features a premium menu serving an eclectic mix of different appetizers and entrees. It offers a very welcoming environment for families or provides an intimate setting for a romantic date. Definitely a must if you live locally or are currently staying in the area !!"
"Staten Island, NY",10/8/2017,4.0,Came for lunch yesterday and the place was super nice from the look on the outside and when you walked it was just and nice. Great ambience. Service was good... wasn't sure who our waitress was wee us like 2-3 or 3 I guess they all share the the tables. Had the pork belly fries they were really good for an appetizer. My wife did the crab cake sliders there were 3 she like them a lot but took em off the bread . I did the burger it was really good and had great taste to it. Good food and good service My only grip is when you looked around a lot of dusk and webs on the lights and up high I mean it shows neglect. Just needs to be dusted and cleaned I was worried some would fall into people's food. But like i said it was a good meal.
"Philadelphia, PA",6/3/2018,3.0,"Set in an old bank, the restaurant itself has a great vibe. The beers, which are made onsite, are small in selection but solid in quality. Unfortunately, the quality of the food just doesn't live up to the wonderful descriptions on the menu. The food isn't bad per se, it just isn't all that good. Overall a solid place to go, but felt a bit disappointing in the end."
"Pittsburgh, PA",1/1/2017,4.0,First time at Vault was great. Pretty busy for a Thursday night. We waited after getting on the list before arriving. The benefit of the wait was the opportunity to begin sampling various offering from this brewery. The Oatmeal Stout and Noel Saison were memorable and perfect for a late December evening.The meal was stellar! The fingerling potatoes with pork belly and cheese are outstanding - as was our server Sam!  I recommend the cheddar waffle grilled cheese with the grassfed burger add on. The variety on the Menu and on tap make me eager to return. The end.
"Philadelphia, PA",7/24/2017,5.0,"TL;DR Great beer, great food.We came in here for a little birthday brewery touring and I'm happy that we did. I had never had their beer before, and we did flights to get through the whole menu without puking ... really solid stuff. Everything was a 4/5 for me.As for the food, it was delicious. We had the duck/apple pizza and the brown sugar buffalo pizza, and both were fantastic. Very flavorful, nicely sized, and a nice thin crispy crust just how I like it. We also had a cherry cordial s'more for dessert, which wasn't half bad.The space is great, too (really cool design) and the town of Yardley is shockingly hip. Great place all around!"
"Langhorne, PA",11/21/2017,4.0,"Harvest beat salad was insanely good and the size was large. It was more lettace than beats but still great. Next is a Wild Mushroom Pizza, it was ok. Ill order something else next time. A bit pricy but worth a second try the next time I need to ear lunch out. Ill try their craft sodas next time as well."
"Princeton, NJ",7/10/2016,4.0,"This place is so cool. First off I'm not a big beer drinker so please skip this review if you're looking nice for specific reviews of the beer. We went early July on a Friday night (expecting a wait, they don't take reservations). It was only about a half hour, but we shared a flight of beers (5 beers - see picture for which ones), and they were good! Some more citrus flavors, grapefruit, and a chocolatey stout one too. Good!We sat down for dinner and decided to order some apps and pizza for dinner -there were 4 of us, and we ordered the buffalo cauliflower (SO good) and the fig & arugula salad (also very good!).  For pizza we ordered 3, and all were spectacular- I'm listing them in order of preference: spicy sausage pizza, farm fresh pizza, and duck and goat cheese pizza. All great- and the atmosphere was really the best- had the old bank vault doors, wine displayed in a wall as well, the safety-deposit boxes as you walked in- very cool to see reg architecture like that!Live music was playing while we're were there - it was a bit noisy but perfect for a Friday night."
"Plymouth Meeting, PA",6/11/2017,4.0,"The weather screamed for a nice long ride with the top down and we ended up here. The building used to be a bank and the decor now incorporates those elements in a very cool way. Our server was great. The beers, though tasty, are served at cask temp, so not quite as refreshing as we hoped for on a blazing hot day. But the food? Oh the food! We had the brunch pizza and buffalo pizza...seriously good, as was my bright and tasty gazpacho. We sat next to the pass and every single thing looked fantastic. If I were a local, I'd be a regular."
"Philadelphia, PA",7/20/2018,5.0,"Went on a summer night for dinner and don't have enough good things to say. We waited for an outside table for about 20 mins. My boyfriend ordered a flight while I had the sangria (which was amazing). I can't believe I didn't get one beer at a brewery but it was just too good. We got the hummus appetizer (just ok, can skip that next time), wild mushroom pizza & waffle grilled cheese. Big portions && soooooo good! We had such a nice night and it was so beautiful out with the sun set. Can't wait to come back!"
"Flemington, NJ",10/31/2017,2.0,"UPDATE: 6/16The service today was absolutely terrible. I have never had such a poor experience at this place. We came in and sat right down. There was no wait, with many tables open. It took over 15 min before someone, anyone came and took our drink orders.  Once we finally got our drinks we felt rushed to order our food in fear that we would have to wait even longer to order. Once ordered the appetizers came out quickly. We had no idea who our waiter or waitress was as they never came back to our table after the first interaction.  We saw the bus boy to clear our plates more often than anyone else. The only person who came to ask how everything was multiple times was Dallas, who did a great job, even though he was not our server. We waited for 30 minutes until our drinks were refilled. The table next to us asked where their food was after having waited over 20 min. Multiple waiters and waitresses were standing around with no sense of urgency whatsoever. All in all it was a horrible experience and I will be considering another place before coming back here, which is sad seeing as the food is good and the service usually is too. Very poor management, very poor experience. Dropped from a 4 star review to a 2. ----------------------------------------------Have been back many many times and the food is always great.  The beers are also awesome!  Haven't had any issues there and will continue to return.  Beer selection that they brew right there in house changes often so its a good idea to go back frequently to try new beers.  The food also changes and is always fresh.  They recently opened there lower bar downstairs which is very nice and clean.  A very laid back place.  Cannot go wrong.  Plan ahead as it does get very busy at times and the wait time can be upwards of 40 min."
"Jersey City, NJ",9/1/2018,5.0,"This place is great. Terrific food, drinks, and overall vibe. We brought our three year old and it was no problem."
"Yardley, PA",6/3/2018,5.0,"Great beer, amazing food and even better s'mores. They have a good rotating beer selection.  They tend to brew a lot of IPAs but have been putting out more wheats and lager type beers. Their flatbread/pizzas are SO good. Highly recommend."
"Summit, NJ",8/15/2016,4.0,"I was pretty favorably impressed , although I admit 4 stars may be a little high.I had the stout and IPA - both good .The chicken sandwich was surprisingly good .It had a fresh taste to it and came with good quality greens and tomato.You could and I did order a side salad.That was also of a reasonably high quality.Service was more than adequate and prices reasonable.I went for a weekday lunch.It's in a nice building and they have a clean restroom.I think they should spruce up  the bar a bit.I noticed you can only get the burger medium, which as a cosequence I would not order."
"Elkins Park, PA",11/9/2015,3.0,"Honestly, I was not impressed by this place. I'd heard good things so I was expecting a typical brewery experience. Unfortunately this place is really only a brewery by default; it's just a restaurant masquerading as a brewery to get a certain demographic in. I wish I'd known that before hand so I could have planned accordingly.Anyway, I was disappointed in how few beers they had on tap. It seems they will only have five beers on at any given time, and one of the beers happened to be kicked so I only had four to choose from. At least the beer itself was good; they have a sweet potato ale which is extremely unique. It tastes very autumnal in that is has the typical spices found in pumpkin beers, but the sweet potato makes it far sweeter (obviously) and gives it a heavier mouth feel. Their imperial IPA was also decent, very floral and fruity on the nose. However it was kind of forgettable. I might have been interested in the food but the prices scared me off. Even for Yardley the prices on food here were obnoxiously high. Plus aside from the pork belly fries, not much of it sounded all that unique or tasty. Perhaps I'm missing a huge piece of the puzzle by not having had the food? Okay, maybe - but for a place that specifically refers to itself as a brewery I come mainly for the beer. Four taps is just not enough. It's just not my thing. The atmosphere is stuffy and stuck up, so unlike any other brewery I've ever been to. I would come back, but I'm really not dying to come back unless they add more taps."
"Southampton, PA",8/21/2017,4.0,"We were seated immediately around 8pm on a Saturday. They have live jazz on Saturdays which is awesome. There's one main seating area, the bar, and another seating area. The music could be heard everywhere inside. They have outside seating, too.The pork belly fries were odd. They were not yellow/brown as fries look when they're fried. They were soft and looked like they were baked. There wasn't a lot of pork belly, but the portion was generous. The antipasta board was great. The meats and cheeses were fresh, and there are two sizes. The small ($9) was great for three people with another appetizer (I think the bigger one would've been to much, plus we got dessert too).The beer is good. I had a flight of the coconut lime IPA, high and dry IPA, rye pale ale, and belgian blonde. The High and Dry tastes funny to me, the Belgian blonde tastes like a Belgian blonde,the coconut lime IPA was cool, and the rye pale ale was the best imo. Someone I was with loved the Belgian Blonde, though. They only have two varieties in cans in the fridge by the door, one of which (Vic Secret IIPA) is not available on tap. I would like to see them have more varieties in cans because you don't have to drink them as quickly before they go bad like growlers.The Buffalo brown sugar pizza was awesome! The brown sugar made it sweet, but the Buffalo made it spicy. I love prosciutto, which is salty, so it was a flavor party in your mouth! The wood-fired s'mores are great as well, messy though. I was able to try the ""black and white"" dessert, vanilla spice custard and chocolate mousse. The vanilla spice is an interesting alternative to regular old vanilla."
"Yardley, PA",5/13/2016,5.0,"This is a great place for the neighborhood.  Are there bars like this all over Philly, sure.  Are there bars like this in our region of Buck County, I haven't heard of any.  Cool atmosphere, great selection of beers, one cider, and some local wine (didn't try any), really good gasto pub type food, both healthy and not so healthy, and music on occasion (check their website).Went there with three friends just to chill and catch up and couldn't ask for a better spot.  We especially were surprised by how well prepared the dishes that we ordered were and my beer loving friends loved their beers."
"Bluffton, SC",3/20/2016,5.0,"Visited with a customer for lunch. Parking is best in the alley area behind the restaurant. What's really cool about this brewpub is this used to be a bank at one time (hence the name Vault). They have old memorabilia on the walls of promissory notes, old checks, letterhead, etc. Not a really extensive menu, but for lunch the pizza seemed to be enough. One of their most popular is the Buffalo Pizza. The blend of sweet and spicy sauce plus cheese was a great savory combination. I couldn't leave without trying their beer. They still had some Trial and Error beer leftover which was their special price offering. I also had the Amarillo IPA. Both were excellent with hoppy notes, but not bitter. TIP--- get there early if you go on weekends. It's not very big and they get very busy."
"Langhorne, PA",2/15/2016,4.0,"Very interesting and cool place. Small, so sometimes hard to find a table, but when you do it's great. I'm not a beer person, so I can't comment on that, but the friends of mine that are love their selection. The atmosphere is great and the food is amazing. So different, and so good! Great place for a unique night out, or for grabbing drinks with friends!"
"Baltimore, MD",10/17/2015,4.0,"The atmosphere of this place is so unique. I love how it still keeps the authentic vault from when it was a bank and adds the modern feel of a brewery. It was Friday night so they had a band playing some smooth jazz which was a nice touch.Now let's get to the food! For starters we ordered the Buffalo califlower, cheese and bread tray and pork belly fries.  My favorite item was the pork belly fries.  The potatoes could have been cooked a slight bit longer but they were still satisfying. Now for the entrees. After tasting the fries,  I ordered the Banh Mi sandwich. This was sandwich was different and delicious. Everything from the pork belly to the cilantro made it a star. I also sampled the duck and apple and the margarita pizza. Enjoyed both especially the duck and apple. Don't let it scare you!. For drinks I had the sangria and the cider. The sangria was yummy and the cider was definitely to my liking because it wasn't too sweet.Had a great time here and would recommend it for a night out with friends."
"Trenton, NJ",6/25/2016,5.0,"Sampled the Simcoe Blonde, which I liked, the Bavarian Hefeweizen,, Chinook Make, Sirachi Ace IPA, the Nelson Sauvin IPA, Mosaic Imperial IPA.  For an appie, had the Cheese and Fruit board and the Buffalo Cauliflower, both delicious.For dinner we had the Duck and Apple pizza with notes of honey & blue cheese, also delicious.For dessert, we shared the S'mores. Which was a nice cap.  Note, we were seated right away, but we weren't approached for an order until we figured out we could ask for samples of the six beer offerings. As soon as we were done our waitress came over.There was a jazz band starting at 7 and there was a band playing in the lot right across the street. Nice evening overall."
"Trenton, NJ",3/13/2019,5.0,I love this place!  The food is wonderful in addition to the beer!
"Langhorne, PA",6/23/2017,5.0,The vault is a great gem of yardley borough. The food is great. The last time I was there I had a cheddar waffle grilled cheese that was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. Their beer that they brew themselves is always great and they do a great job of rotating their selections.
"Chicago, IL",8/11/2018,3.0,Nice menu. Recommend the fig salad. Stay away from the house wines - the reds are served cold. Not friendly service. Came on our way to the Trenton airport. Not impressed.
"New Brunswick, NJ",2/28/2017,5.0,"Great great brewery and restaurant!! I went here for dinner with a friend and we absolutely loved it! The ambiance is great, the decor is nice and the service was wonderful and fast. They even have outdoor seating weather permitting. I was excited to try the beer, I had the Belgium blonde and really liked it. For food we got the hummus board trio to start, it was very very good, tasty and fresh. It had three different types of house made hummus(avocado, spicy red pepper and black bean) and really good soft bread and mixed veggies for dipping. The presentation of all our food was on point. For entrees, I got the wild mushroom pizza and my friend got the crab cake sliders. I heard they have good pizza here and boy were they right! You must order pizza here! My pizza was delicious and tasty; the mushrooms were seasoned and cooked well. The best part of it was the pizza dough, it was crispy but soft in the inside. So good! They have other unique pizzas to choose from like duck pizza. For dessert we got the wood fired s'mores; it was nothing special but we wanted something sweet to share. Overall, this is an great place I would recommend to everyone. I definitely will be back again for one of there jazz nights and to eat more pizza!"
"Trenton, NJ",5/8/2016,5.0,"This place was Awesome!!!  I had the Buffalo Califlower for a starter!  Awesome!  Then I had the the cheese Pizza.  What a treat!  It was a tad bit bigger than a regular sized personal pan Pizza, had fresh ingredients and was cooked to perfection .  My wife had the burger, which they told her when she ordered it they can only make it rare, we'll it was just that...lol.. . but for a person who eat everything well done she enjoyed it for the most part.  We shared a sampling of beer that was palette pleasing.Gorgeous place, Outside seating and workers are friendly.   I would return!"
"Morrisville, PA",8/21/2017,4.0,Fun place in town for craft beer and light pub fare.Patio is tight but adequate.Enjoy the flatbread pizzas.
"Morrisville, PA",12/26/2016,1.0,"My husband and I eat here a few times a month.  Always great.  Today not so much.  Our server Suzanne was horrible.  Slow and not responsive.  Our food was also not so good.  We ordered the antipasto board and sausage pizza.  We didn't realize there had been a change to the sausage pizza.  There were tons of raw green peppers and onions on top.  Not a fan.Update.  Ate (tried to) today.  Waited a long time for our lunch which was fine since they were so busy.  My husband's food was made with everything he asked to be removed, mine came with the wrong side dish.  I sent mine back and it was sent back to me with the wrong main dish.   I sent it back again and didn't have anything to eat.  Both meals were ice cold.  Manager took my meal off of the bill but not really the point.  I'm running out of places to eat in our area.  Ugh."
"Plainsboro, NJ",1/26/2019,5.0,Fantastic interior- super vibe- really great beer and delicious food. The way it is laid out it can accommodate large groups but without feeling crowded . The pizza is fantastic lots of interesting combinations of toppings and wonderful crust.
"Brooklyn, NY",5/13/2018,3.0,"Too much hype over nothing, only good thing here is online reservation system. Otherwise, pizza was the kind you can expect at Sesame Place (despite a fancy oven), onion soup must have been made using a recipe from google, and finally the beer sucked."
"Morrisville, PA",3/7/2019,4.0,"Very good food, drinks, and friendly staff. It is a bit tight at times in the front And the bussers can be in the way when they walk by."
"Princeton, NJ",4/14/2017,4.0,This place is really cute. Drink menu is pretty limited if you're not a beer drinker (like me) but food was yummy. The buffalo cauliflower was really good as was the hummus trio. The beet salad was good but too heavy on the frisée IMO. The layout of the place is cute & across the street parking is a selling point. Def worth trying :)
"Pennington, NJ",2/15/2019,5.0,Always interesting beers and some of the best thin  crust pizza around. Love the jazz on Friday nights too.
"Morrisville, PA",12/24/2016,3.0,"For us, just an okay local place.  Do like that they brew their own beers, just not my preferred range of beer type style.  Like that they make small craft pizza pies, but how much pizza  an one eat time after time.  Would like to see some growth in menu options that align with the atmosphere more along meals vs. tappas inspired.  Will be back from time to time."
"Trenton, NJ",6/18/2018,3.0,"First timers to this little gem and came highly recommended. The Pizza was amazing as well as the service, but  my husband is allergic to canola oil and they use canola oil in everything and I mean everything.  So he had to get a salad without dressing.   Boo............  Come on people it's 2018 Canola is Rapeseed.  Just Google how bad the stuff really is for humans.   Most restaurants have already changed from Canola oil to Soybean or Olive Oil."
"Abington, PA",5/22/2017,5.0,"A friend and I stopped in here over the weekend on a whim. We immediately loved the decor inside and were seated at a high top in the adjoining room to the bar with a view of the stainless casks. The place was hoppin for a saturday afternoon. I was going to order the breakfast stout, and my friend the chinook, but then we decided to split a flight. You typically get 4 beers in a flight, but our server brought us all 7. We LOVED them. I am not an IPA person, or so I thought, but they were all incredible, and I loved one so much I ended up buying a 4-pack of the Mosaic IPA. Even the cans are cool looking...On to the food...we ordered the pork belly fries, the mushroom pizza, and the waffle grilled cheese. All of it was absolutely incredible. The pizza had huge local mushrooms, fresh arugula, and truffle ricotta. The crust was perfectly done and had that wood fired taste.The waffle was slightly bland on its own, but was served with a delicious tomato soup type thing that was the perfect complement. And the pork belly fries...oh goodness. Huge pieces of pork belly and roasted fingerling potatoes. Heaven on a plate. Our server was fabulous. So nice, so knowledgeable...recommended great food to try and couldn't have been more helpful. I will absolutely be returning to this gem."
"University City, Philadelphia, PA",4/2/2017,4.0,"The restaurant is cool to look at... but, The lighting is dim and can get very crowded too.  We had the hummus as an appetizer which was pretty good and sangria for drinks also pretty good.  For dinner I had the brisket sandwich which was good but I guess I expected more after reading reviews.  I may stop by again to try the pizza."
"Midland, TX",1/27/2018,5.0,"Really great place! Had the Cuban sandwich, fresh water and a dessert to die for which was the s'mores, The waitress said slash of peanut butter and she was right!The waitress was really really attentive and fast overall I would highly recommend this place and I'm glad my great buddy showed me this place!"
"Doylestown, PA",9/3/2013,3.0,"Nine months later, and I think the child has been born. On my revisit, the beer has hit its stride. I had the pleasure of having a british bitter which included galaxy hops through a hop infuser. And they had it three different ways, nitro, draught and on cask. I stuck to the cask version. It was a smooth drinking session beer with very nice hop aroma, and taste. The beer had almost a tea like quality to it, and was softened by the fact it was on cask. Very nice beer.To eat, I had a flatbread, with duck confit, peach, grape, arugala, and goat cheese. Beautiful mixture of the salty and the sweet on their house made crust. One of the best pizza I have had in a long time."
"Ridgefield, NJ",1/10/2016,4.0,"First off, how awesome is it that this place is built inside of an old bank?! I literally spent the entire time trying to figure out how the place used to look and it's still crazy to me. Nice selection of beer. I really enjoyed the coffee tasting one (can't remember the name). Definitely have to try their pizzas, and if you sit close enough to the kitchen you can watch them make everything."
"Warrington, PA",4/9/2017,5.0,We went toDinner here sat night we got there early and were seated right away. It was very crowded by the time we left.  The beer was excellent. We had the Cuban it was amazing served with sweet potato chips and the brisket sand also delish. Would def go back
"Morrisville, PA",2/2/2019,5.0,I've been to the vault several times over the years since the opening. Was there the other night and to my surprise they now offer a happy hour from 4 to 6 PM. What a great deal. Had an extremely stressful day and thinking of the vault made me get through it. Beers are so tasty and staff is very attentive and welcoming
"Chester, PA",12/18/2017,4.0,"Really cool place to try! The ambiance is amazing.. so relaxing and cool. They have a good selection of beers AND wines, which is so exciting because my boyfriend loves beer and I definitely prefer wine... so it suits both of us well! My boyfriend had the Armada IPA and I had the Riesling. Both the beer and wine were really good.     The food menu has a great selection of starters, sandwiches, salads and pizzas. We had the pork belly fries for a starter. I wasn't crazy about them, but they were good. I had the wild mushroom pizza which was DELICIOUS. So cheesy and all of the toppings complimented it well. The best part was the crust, it was just so so good. My boyfriend had the waffle grilled cheese & he really liked it. It was served with a delicious tomato soup and sweet potato chips.      Everything was just really well done. The food, the drinks and the atmosphere. It all makes a great place to have a great time. We're already planning our next trip back!!"
"Baltimore, MD",4/12/2017,5.0,"Cool place, love when old buildings get repurposed.  Had a flight of beer and all were quality options. Went with the duck and apple pizza - very tasty and would recommend to others.I travel a lot for work and this seemed like a good option within a short driving distance of the hotel.  I'm happy with my decision and would eat here again."
"Collingswood, NJ",1/4/2015,3.0,"I've been to Vault Brewing twice now. My review is teetering around 3.5. On the positive side, the beers here are pretty good. I've been to dozens of brew pubs across NJ and PA and most of the time the beer is mediocre at best. I find the beer at Vault to be above par. I've tried a couple of beers here and have always been pretty happy with my selections. My favorite so far has been the Kenyan Coffee Stout. Mmmm I could probably have it with my breakfast. I've also enjoyed the food here, albeit it's on the pricey side, it is pretty fresh tasting. Highly recommend the brown sugar buffalo pizza and wild mushroom pizza. On my last visit I had the braised brisket sandwich which was also good. Now there are a few things that bring the rating down here. First off the service is pretty spotty. Not horrible but not exactly friendly nor super attentive. The prices are a bit high for what you get. Think an average of $13 for a sandwich and $15 for pizza. Also I recommend staying away from the pad thai popcorn. For $6 you will get something that more closely resembles a handful of kettle corn than any type of gourmet popcorn. I'm biased when it comes to writing reviews for brewpubs as I consider Iron Hill to have really set the standard for great food, good beer, and awesome service. Check out Vault for pizza and a beer and you'll be satisfied."
"Morrisville, PA",5/26/2016,5.0,"Came here for the second time. Second visit was by far better than the first. The first visit was a Friday night, around 10:30-11:00 for a drink with a friend. Only one bartender for the place, not much of a welcome, perhaps he was just busy. He recommended some good beers we had a nice time. The interior is beautiful and clean. Seemed odd that a little before midnight we were told it was last call, on a Friday. Came today for a lunch date with my dog. Had an absolutely FANTASTIC afternoon. We were greeted so enthusiastically. It was hot out, they brought my dog water right away without me asking. I enjoyed my book and an IPA on the deck. Had the duck & apple pizza after the recommendation of one of the staff, oh my gawd that pizza was DELICIOUS!!!! A nice environment with great beer and food, and I can bring my pup, will be frequenting this place!"
"Mullica Hill, NJ",12/27/2016,2.0,"Monday after Christmas and this place was packed.   We were told it would be a 45 minute wait.   We gave our cell phone number to be paged when our table was ready.   Lucky for us it was about 30 minutes.  The place is cute and looks like a bank vault when entering.   Not kid friendly at all.   No kids menu or even willing to modify anything on the menu for kids.   They only have craft sodas at $3.50 each.   We ordered two cream soda which came in water glasses.  For this much, I expected something a little nicer.   It tastes like seltzer water to me.   They must have skimped on the cream.  The food was mediocre at best. We had the fried cauliflower, pork belly fries and margarita pizza.   The fries were definitely the stand out menu item.   The pizza was horrible.   Tangy sauce, a few small pieces of very thin mozzarella and a few sparse bay leaves.  The buffalo cauliflower was too spicy for my taste.  Our waitress was so busy she never checked on us.  We went without water during our meal.     She forgot I have her my credit card and delivered a check twice to our table.  We would not go back."
"Charlotte, NC",4/12/2015,3.0,"Two of my guy friends and I stopped off at vault brewery on our little brewery tour to Riverhorse brewery in Ewing, New JerseyThis tiny little restaurant and brewery is tucked into what appears to be an old bank right on Main Street in Yardley, Pennsylvania. They don't have a very high brewery capacity. They seem to maintain around 5 to 6 brews. We were seated quickly on high top chairs. There is a subtle sense of class in this place. There isn't a television, thus eliminating the sports lounge vibe. There is lots of dark wood, copper, mirrors , and subtle lighting. I guess you say say there's a sense of elegance in this location that you don't typically find in breweries. When a beer wasn't available on the menu there was a simple stamp over it that said ""kickedl. Instead of having it scribble it out or leaving on the menu it was a much better way of sharing information while still looking classy.Both of my guy friends order the beer sampler, it is two dollars a beer. One thoroughly enjoyed the rye IPA, and the other the Irish stout. Overall, they were happy with the quality of all the beers. I ordered the pork belly fries the table. I thought it was interesting that they chose fingerling potatoes. But, it worked. You would get these kind of thick fingerling potatoes with a little bit of cheese and a nice fat blob of pork belly. My arteries were totally thrilled.The only thing I didn't appreciate was the slightly snotty mannerism of the waitress. My less observant guy friends even picked up on it questioning what her problem was. Regardless, every one had a bad day and it didn't ruin our experience here."
"Newtown, PA",5/4/2015,3.0,"As I write this update, I think of all the times prior to Saturday I have come to Vault.  I've observed changes, chiefly the call ahead policy being no more.  The new system texts you an approximate seating time. Okay, that's an improvement. I like not being in table limbo. This trip to Vault was a birthday dinner. Our estimated seating time was 8:23 and we used it to walk around. Once at our table, we were brought outside.  Early on, I snuck away from the table to inform our waitress about bringing out bread pudding and s'mores.  Sounds like a nice surprise, right?Before I continue, our table shared a beer flight, hummus, the pork belly sandwich, crab cake sliders, etc.  As always, I've never had a bad meal (the words don't even belong in the same sentence!)  I'll give our waitress kudos for keeping a close eye on how far we were into our food before the dessert came out...and that's where I'm a little surprised myself.What should have been exciting ended up nothing short of an awkward exchange.  The waitress and her coworker set out the desserts, lit the candle on the bread pudding, and ""Um, it's your birthday..!"" *waitress and coworker rush away*  ""Happy birthday"" doesn't need to have bells, whistles, and singing.  Just smile, say it, and ""enjoy!""  I don't think that would have upset the atmosphere, especially when  you've got drunk people singing who-knows-what at the tables facing the road!"
"Medford, NJ",12/13/2018,5.0,"Last evening after seeing the ""Light Show"" we decided to have a meal at the ""Vault"" not realizing there was high top seating only. I was with my 90+ y/o in laws. Without missing a beat the hostess addressed the issue and they literally brought in a low table and chairs to accommodate us. That was really above and beyond. We had a fantastic meal and went home feeling ever so pleased. Staff was amazing as was the food! Highly recommend."
"Philadelphia, PA",9/10/2016,4.0,"bring back the pork belly banh mi whaaaaaaat. and your sweet potato ale needs to be all year, amazin"
"Morristown, NJ",1/3/2015,4.0,"Came with a group of 10 friends on a Friday night and had to wait 1.5 hrs for a table. That was the only downside. Service was overall on point and friendly. Food prices were a bit on the pricey side but beer was reasonable. They have some unique items on their menu but overall the menu isn't the typical pub menu and is not extensive.Belgian blonde - very good after taste, citrus and wheat, you can taste the hoppinessDuck and Apple flatbread (pizza) - if I based my review on only this dish, I would give it 5 stars. Perfect mix of sweet and salty. Good portion too and was not soggy at all.Chicken panini - average, nothing special to write home aboutOverall, I'd come back with a smaller group of people to grab a beer or try their flatbread pizzas."
"New Hope, PA",2/4/2017,4.0,Nice outdoor seating with some terrific beers to try while sampling some tasty treats. You must try the Buffalo Cauliflower as it is the best I've had and worth a trip.Pork belly fries and burgers were good.  Pizza was delicious but the stand out was the cauliflower and beers.
"Athens-Clarke County, GA",10/15/2015,5.0,"The faces on the patrons in a full house on Thursday night say it all!  Lively conversation and smiles while enjoying great beer and food with a live Saxophone and guitar duo playing in the background.  I'm here from out of town and the bartender offering perspective on the different IPAs, offering a taste, and not making me feel funny when I ordered ""what ever appetizer they are having"" (by me pointing) was awesome.  I settled on a delicious porter draft and a half board of the charcuterie (three cured meats, two cheeses, pickled veggies, and warm pretzel bread) delicious and the half portion was more than I could eat.  I travel A LOT and this is easily the best brew pub I've ever visited (atmosphere, beer, and food).  Great find!!!!"
"trenton, NJ",6/30/2018,5.0,"Really good, fresh food. The atmosphere was great and although it was busy when we went on a Saturday night, there wasn't a long wait. Varying options despite a smaller menu than the average chain restaurant."
"Orland Park, IL",12/5/2018,4.0,"I had the Beef Brisket and the sample beers and they were all fantastic. All beers were very tasty as described on the menu. Highly recommended if you are into craft beers, beer is better than the Triumph brewery."
"Lawrenceville, NJ",2/26/2018,5.0,"The beers are great. The pizza is great. Any other food we tried was great! Cool atmosphere in an old bank with brick oven.  Long wait if no reservation with an overcrowded bar area, but not a bad time. They also have a downstairs bar area which I didn't see until much later."
"Aventura, FL",3/19/2018,4.0,On our trip to New Hope stopped into the Vault to try their selection of beers OK meet but delicious  burgers. Service ok
"Boston, MA",1/11/2018,5.0,"Such a fun place to come with friends or even a date night, especially in the spring when the patio is open!  Great beer selections and wine too - the sangria is where it's at.  I would 100% recommend the buffalo cauliflower app, it's life changing.  Also the duck pizza, or really any of the pizzas.  You also can't go wrong with the salad's, the buffalo chicken just happens to be my favorite.  The closest thing you'll get to a ""city"" style restaurant in a small town!"
"Mount Pleasant, SC",6/9/2018,5.0,"This is such a fun place to dine. The place itself  is very trendy and the food is so good. I like the story behind the Resturant too, I.t adds a lotOf character. I'd 100% go back"
"New Windsor, NY",4/8/2018,2.0,"My bf and I were in the area (after traveling 2 1/2 hrs for an event) and were pretty excited to try this brewery after reading a few good reviews. Sadly, we didn't have the same experience. When viewing pictures of the brewery, what initially caught my eye was the warm atmosphere and design of the bar area. However, when we got there, there was no seating in the main room so we were seated in a generic looking side room next to a large family that had young kids. (Mind you, my bf and I are 30 and stopped in to try a few of their beers in what was advertised as a brewery setting. Not a side dinning room with loud children.) Despite the disappointment, we ordered a couple beers and a few plates of food. The IPA I ordered was okay. However, I didn't feel it was anything worth telling my friends about. For dinner, I ordered the beets. When they came out, they were served over a bed of yellow lettuce that looked less than appetizing and the beets were still hot. Yuck. As for the service, we were approached by 3-4 different workers, so there was no opportunity to form a relationship with our waitress and we couldn't communicate our needs efficiently. Additionally, we were there for over an hour and not once did anyone come over to ask if we wanted a second beer. (Kind of odd for a brewery) Finally, while my bf and I were conversing and finishing our one beer, someone came over and propped the check book up in front of my bf's face and walked off. I found that extremely rude and decided to never eat here again."
"East Windsor, NJ",1/30/2015,5.0,"Really enjoyed this place......we live in the Princeton area, and headed over towards Yardley for a change of place.Nice atmosphere, good vibe, fresh ingredients.If you are looking for something new, different, and a nice/upscale environment- give it a shot."
"Trenton, NJ",5/21/2017,4.0,"Came for the craft beer and Vault did not disappoint. Ordered a sample flight, which gives you 4 to try, but I added on 1 more for kicks. The beers were definitely tasty and paired nicely with the overall atmosphere. Rarely did you see people on their phones; instead people were enjoying each other's company and actually conversing! Although I did not eat, the food looked pretty delicious as I sat close enough to watch the chefs make it. It would be nice if they could add more brew tour time slots, but that would not keep me away from coming back for more."
"Barrington, NJ",5/2/2015,3.0,"We were in the area, looked on Yelp for a brewery to have lunch.  The menu was ok, small, not your average menu, no kids menu.  I got the chicken sandwich, it was good, the bread was very crunchy & yummy. My husband had the brisket sandwich, it was ok, tasted more like roast beefy then brisket.  The sandwiches are a la carte, sides are extra, & no fries!!?!? There is no kids menu so we ordered a Margherita pizza for them to share, which was good.  There was only a choice of 6 beers.  I don't usually order the kids soda, but it was a long day of soccer, however they only have craft soda in more adult favors, they tried the hibiscus, both kids hated it. I drank a little it was ok, I'm not a fan of soda.  This place was ok for us as a family, maybe better for adults.  We do not live in the area, so I will not be back."
"Fan District, VA",9/2/2017,5.0,"Passing through town on the way to a wedding. Fantastic experience from start to finish! I started out with a flight of 4 of their beers. I enjoyed all 4. Came with 2 friends and we shared 3 things. We started with the buffalo cauliflower, which was a really nice beginning. It came with delicious pickled celery as a fun twist. We then had the prosciutto and fig salad, which came with fresh arugula, asparagus, and shaved provolone. It was so fresh and every bite was a pop in your mouth! The finale was the waffle grilled cheese (I know, right?!). Several cheeses ""waffled"" between two cheddar waffles. Errrr my gawd!!!! Whoever thought of this is a genius! It came with a yummy tomato soup for dipping and a side of sweet potato chips. Wait staff was very attentive! We sat outside and it started raining while we were there. We were happy to stay outside, so they staff ensured we were fully covered by the umbrella. If I'm ever passing through again, this will be a must stop!"
"Morristown, NJ",9/19/2017,2.0,"This place is really just ok for food.  I love the location in downtown Yardley, but getting to the parking lot from Main St was pretty confusing... luckily I found street parking nearby, just keep in mind that street parking in front of the restaurant is only for 1 hour.  This place was already pretty crowded on Friday night when I arrived at 5pm but luckily, no wait for us!  We sat in the far back corner, a table with a bench and two chairs for 4 of us and a baby (no high chairs or booster seats available here) and it felt really tight and restrictive.  I was really unimpressed with the food... I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries... the chicken sandwich was very messy and the bacon was not crispy and very fatty, but overall the flavors were good.  The fries were not fries and really not tasty at all - think a cut up potato that someone mixed around in oil... very thick, no crisp, just oily potato.  Maybe this place is more ideal for just grabbing drinks - my friends really enjoyed the Sweet Potato Ale (described as ""very smooth"")"
"Pittsburgh, PA",9/11/2017,2.0,"Food is good, non-hoppy beer is good (I don't like IPAs-if you do, you might like-I don't know. Service is horrible, and not for lack of personnel. I sat at the bar, where two others were seated while four staffers kibbutzed while I waited to order a beer. After all, the reason I came to a brewpub was to get a beer. After waiting approximately 7 minutes and 34 seconds on a fairly dead night (may have been longer, didn't start the stopwatch on the phone right away), I finally got my first beer, the Sweet Potato Ale.  After waiting approximately an equal amount of time, I was able to order and receive my second beer, the Extra Stout.I would have probably had at least one more, but I decided to cut my losses and wait out the time to get my check.   I'm as low maintenance as it gets. Get me a beer, ask me if I want another one while my glass sits empty on the bar, then give me my check timely when I want to leave. Sadly, none of this happened tonight. If the beer and food weren't good, I'd have penalized them by giving them only one star.I will still visit here as it's the closest brewpub to home, but it'll be a while."
"Newark, NJ",10/21/2018,5.0,Great place to enjoy some beer!! Good food as well ! Must try the buffalo cauliflower which is absolutely delicious !!! Beers are very good think they have 8 on tap at any time !
"Bucks County, PA",10/25/2016,4.0,"While Vault is most likely known for their beer, which is brewed on-site, they offer a unique selection of pizzas, sandwiches, salads and more.We came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and went with the Margherita Traditional pizza and Chicken & Greens salad. I have yet to confirm this, but I tasted some beer in their pizza sauce. While it surprised me at first, I thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and I think the subtle taste of beer was a great addition to the sweet sauce.My fiancé has been on a recent chickpea kick and decided on the Chicken & Greens salad as soon as she saw it. The chicken was good and the chickpeas provided a nice contrast to the strong tomato flavors (roasted tomato vinaigrette and heirloom cherry tomatoes). If it's true that everything old is new again, Vault is as modern as can be. The restaurant has a cool atmosphere that's unique to their specific location.Definitely worth checking out."
"Oakland, CA",4/19/2016,4.0,"I have family in the area, and every time I'm back for a visit, a trip to the Vault is a must. I really like the beer, food, and atmosphere here. It has also been pretty packed whenever I've been here (weekends), which shows how great it is.On my most recent visit, we tried a flight of beers and then each got a couple of pints. My favorites of the day were the Amarillo IPA and the Belgian Blonde. I'm a huge IPA and Belgian fan, and I was happy with both. The other beers we tried were a bit lackluster. For food, we got the Wild Mushroom flatbread and Buffalo Cauliflower. I love their flatbreads in general, and the mushroom is one of my favorites. Great ingredients and excellent flavors. This was the first time I tried the Buffalo Cauliflower, and it was sooooo good! The sweet pickled celery added a great balance of flavors. Overall, it was highly addicting. I would come back just for that.Parking is in back, and if it is crowded can be hard to get. The staff have always been great. Our waitress on our most recent visit was awesome, and she knew exactly when to check in with us to see if we needed anything.Overall, their beer is good, the food is great, and I love the atmosphere."
"Trenton, NJ",9/24/2018,2.0,"The beer is great, but if you are a Vegan, forget about finding food to go with it. The restaurant used to have a Vegan version of their pulled pork sandwich (made with grilled tofu) that was quite delicious. Unfortunately, they took it off the menu and replaced it with---nothing."
"Raleigh, NC",10/29/2016,5.0,BBQ pizza was so yum . Love the decor inside it feels soWarm and cozy. The wait is usually a little long but the food and brews are fantastic ! Glad this little restaurant is in the town.
"Manhattan, NY",5/10/2015,5.0,Buffalo cauliflower is out of this world...it's amazing. Awesome beers too. They have live music and it can get crowded on Saturday nights - try to get there early. Pizzas are great!
"Morrisville, PA",11/11/2016,5.0,Wonderful addition to the town of Yardley. The beer is amazing and always changing with great surprises. The food is perfect for the atmosphere - Brick-oven pizza is the goto!Try the pork-belly fries - OMG!
"Warrington, PA",9/18/2016,5.0,"Never had a bad meal here....today we tried the new beet salad...beets were warm...delicious...the chili was hearty and meaty..not soupy...a little heat...filling and great!....next came the cuban..YUM..and the sweet potatoes chips were hands down the best we've ever had...the arugula and prosciutto salad was pretty basic...I wish there was more prosciutto and shaved parmesan  considering the large amount of arugula that came with the salad. Overall, we left full and highly satisfied!!"
"Washington Crossing, PA",10/14/2017,5.0,"Excellent quality, amazing staff, fantastic ownership! Constantly improving themselves, never satisfied with great because they're driven for perfection! They are always trying new beers and perfecting their best brews! Trial & Error beers released on Tuesday Nights are awesome, always getting to try something experimental! I've been to Asheville, NC and back, trying tons of breweries, and the Vault definitely has some of the best beer and atmosphere around! The food is Awesome too!!"
"Langhorne, PA",9/2/2017,4.0,Cool old bank that's now a great brewery.  Nice outdoor seating area if the weather is good.  Flatbreads are yummy with a good beer.  We enjoy coming here with our family and friends occasionally to have a night out.  Kid friendly.
"Croydon, PA",1/28/2018,2.0,"We called at 1130 and stated we had a party of 11 and they said, come in whenever, no problem. When we arrived, 1pm, we had to wait 45 minutes which was fine but due to the fact that we called, it caught us off guard. When we sat down, the tables were disjointed and we were about 4/5 menus and silverware short (which was never fixed). The service was slow and the food was subpar. One member ordered a grilled cheese and was the last to receive his food/ had to wait 20 minutes longer than everyone else. During this time, the waitress never addressed it or told us, they obviously forgot. Our waters weren't filled the entire time and the selection of non-alcoholic drinks etc was slim to none. After many good reviews from friends, we decided to try this Restaurant but we will not be returning. This place is horrible for large parties. Not worth the price."
"Wayne, PA",5/13/2017,1.0,"Came in here with my 18 month old and husband, asked for a table for 2 and a high chair, said it would be a 15 minute wait, we were a little apprehensive as it was hitting dinner time for my son but decided to wait and get a couple beers. Bartender was really rude when I ordered, looked up and down at me and stared at my id for 20 seconds. Finally got a table, was taken to the tiniest of table, and BOOM when I asked for a high chair was told there wasn't any, after specifically booking the table with a high chair. No way was my toddler going to sit there without a high chair. So sat down our basically full beers and left. If you don't want to be child friendly with high chairs for the love of god tell us that before we wait 15 minutes for a table with a hungry child."
"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",4/30/2014,4.0,"Mmmm Vault you are so delicious! I have been here quite a few times now. They change their menu often and they brew their own beers.Lets start with price. It's in Yardley, so be prepared to pay up. When I go with my boyfriend it's usually about $45 total for the two of us. That's not bad, but that's not so great either. The food I will say, though, is worth the price. Vault makes small, personal sized pizzas. They call them ""flatbread style"". However, it still looks and tastes like pizza. Now, if you like traditional pizza flavors Vault might not be for you. I've never had a pizza there I didn't enjoy. They re always crispy, fresh, and delicious tasting. They also had carrot soup once - yum! They have so much great stuff on the menu the I want to try, but my boyfriend and I never get because we want the pizza so much. I will add that I do not enjoy their pizza reheated. The beer- awesome. Obviously since they're a micro brewery they don't have large selection. I haven't tried all their beers cause I tend to prefer dark sours and stouts. What I have had has always been great though! Vault also has a really cool Ambiance. It sounds weird, but I'm very judgmental about bathrooms and the woman's bathroom is super clean and super cool looking. Overall awesome place. A favorite of mine."
"Allen, TX",9/28/2017,5.0,Great place! The ambience was incredible but the food was even better! I had the Buffalo Cauliflower with pickled celery...nothing like it anywhere else. The Duck pizza with apples didn't sound very good but it was recommended so I had that as well. It was a great surprise and not what I expected. I sat at the bar downstairs and my bartender was great and very friendly. I would highly recommend this place!!
"Charleston, SC",8/4/2016,5.0,First time at The Vault. Great food. We had the antipasto as a starter. Very traditional antipasto all fresh ingredients. Next we ordered the prosciutto and fig salad and the brown sugar buffalo pizza. Both were delicious. The English Pale was very tasty and smooth. My husband and son enjoyed the PI IPA. Our server was very pleasant and the food arrived in a timely fashion. Overall experience was excellent.
"Bensalem, PA",11/14/2016,5.0,Came here for dinner with friends of ours. The restaurant itself is a topic of conversation itself and has a really nice ambiance. Ordered the pork belly fries and brown sugar buffalo pizza. Both were yummy but the pizza was one of the best I've had. All the flavors really worked together. If you like sweet and savory with a tiny hint of spice try this!! You can't go wrong. The service was good too. My boyfriend and I live in Miami and were seeing friends we hadn't seen in months and the waitresses let us sit and talk and checked on us enough that we were never without a drink food or our check. Will be back for sure.
"Atlantic Highlands, NJ",12/14/2015,3.0,"I was fairly unimpressed with Vault, I have to agree with several other Yelpers that it is a bit pretentious and really overpriced.  Service was ok. I never knew so many Hipsters were in Yardley these days. But that is obviously the target demographic here, walking in here with a shirt and tie on I felt awkward.  A steady stream of bearded guys in flannel and skinny jeans were in and out.More importantly the food and beer. I had one beer, the stout, it was pretty good not amazing but pretty good, and for a craft beer, this I will say was the one thing decently priced at $6. I ordered the brisket sandwich, it was good but messy as hell. They put it on this tiny little plank of wood, this sandwich needs to be on a plate. It's too messy and I spent most of the time trying not to get it all over the bar and myself. The bread was good but hard so I couldn't really cut it without making more of a mess.  While the sandwich itself was pretty good, it was not worth $14 for just a smaller sandwich with no sides. To me that is ridiculous for what this was, a side salad, or kale whatever hipsters eat, something for that price tag should come with it. This is the burbs not Central Park West. A lunch menu would be beneficial here. The bartender was nice, but again I felt awkward in a shirt and tie coming from a meeting.I don't know if I'd come back, after dropping over $20 on an OK lunch."
"Lambertville, NJ",5/27/2017,3.0,"Just ok, brisket sandwich was well done, meat over cooked not sandwich was done well. Beer was just ok."
"Philadelphia, PA",8/15/2017,5.0,"Finally!!! A cool, semi-fancy yet laid back place on Main Street with reliably awesome food and great wine and beer. The brown sugar buffalo pizza with prosciutto and buffalo cauliflower would keep me coming back, even if the beers weren't great! Do a flight and try them out, you can even take growlers home."
"Morrisville, PA",6/2/2017,3.0,The food was ok.  I wasn't a fan of the limited beers they had to offer.  The waitress had to keep going to the kitchen and bar to ask questions.
"Queens, NY",11/10/2015,4.0,"This is a fun, local brewery with lots of options on tap, and usually one cider available. The food is not bad, I particularly enjoy the pork belly fries! However, I find the brown sugar buffalo pizza to be too sweet. I also enjoy their craft sodas, which are pretty tasty for when you are not in the mood for alcohol. Also, they have live jazz on the weekends!"
"Jackson, NJ",3/12/2017,1.0,"I may have given this a better review if we actually got a table and we're able to eat. I used the yelp app to get on the wait list and it notified me it would be 20-30 min 1 hour 15 min later I got a text they had a table. We obviously left after 30 min. While there I had the only Chardonnay they sell which was a local wine that was horrible, they only sell their own beer as well i guess it works if u like beer and crapy wine"
"Manhattan, NY",3/2/2014,4.0,"After a long day of thrifting, Vault was the perfect end. They have a reservation system that texts you when your table is ready. So convenient! And after many thrift shops, a little less human interaction was fantastic. There was a very unique live jazz ensemble--instead of piano, the main melody was played on xylophone. Perfect way to unwind and have a beer. I loved the Vault IPA so much that I have to mention it before any of the other food. It's not overly hoppy and has a fantastic balance (and I love hoppy beer so it's hard for me to say that). Easily one of the best brews made in Pennsylvania. Everyone should start with the sriracha buffalo cauliflower (I already have plans to try to recreate these for an upcoming housewarming party!) It's perfect if you like spice and a lot of flavor. We sampled several pizzas: the duck and apple (my personal favorite of the evening), the wild mushroom (which was also very good, as are most things with truffle oil), and the margherita. The latter was our only pie with red sauce, which was wayyyyyyy too sweet for my liking."
"Bronx, NY",8/27/2017,4.0,"Like most popular microbreweries, its crowded and noisy at peak periods. The service is prompt and straightforward. The tables are a bit too close but the food more than makes up for that. I can recommend the brisket sandwich. It was served on Italian semolina bread with a dollop of Boursin cheese. The side tossed salad of mixed greens was fresh laced with a balsamic dressing. I enjoyed nursing the rich notes in my beer as well.  My wife loved her crab cake sliders although the complimentary side of homemade sweet potato chips was surprisingly paltry. I attempted to return the following evening with my larger family but the hostess, all business, no high chairs and no regrets, clearly signaled she wasn't interested in accommodating us. So our party of six were welcomed to a pleasant experience at the Continental Tavern a few steps away."
"Morrisville, PA",1/18/2016,4.0,"Just an all around fantastic brew house and restaurant. The brown sugar pizzas are really delicious with a slightly bitter style beer since the sweetness of the pizza balances it out. The most interesting part of this place is the unique atmosphere since this place use to be an old bank you can really notice it in the decor. I docked a star because it is a bit pricy for food and drinks, but you do get great service, food, and drinks so take it as you will. I'd recommend at least stopping in to give this place a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"Morrisville, PA",11/26/2017,3.0,"This place was nice, good wine selection. Its a good place to go for a casual dinner or just drinks and an appetizer. It can get very crowded during peak hours on the weekend. I love the antipasto appetizer (theres a nice selection of meats, cheeses, bread) and the crab cakes. My only issue is that theres not much I can eat since I am gluten free. They are well known for their pizzas, which I hear are really good. Service is always good here. The staff is not pushy if you still don't know what to order and even provide recommendations if asked. The Vault is a bit pricey though but I think the food/drinks are worth it."
"New York, NY",6/18/2016,4.0,"Let's talk about the brown sugar buffalo pizza, shall we?  From first bite you will literally be in love and fall out of your chair because your mouth has never experienced anything so delicious. It will blow you away. It's the perfect balance of salty and sweet and you will be dreaming of it every day. 5 stars for the pizza. 5 stars for the $1 house salad. 2.5 stars for the crab cake sliders. My husband enjoyed them but I found them mushy and fishy without real flavor. I wasn't able to finish 1 of them because I was turned off. Or maybe it was because I had a piece of that pizza heaven prior to trying the crab cakes?  Either way - I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Live jazz music, great atmosphere both inside and out. I look forward to my return. And did I mention the pizza??"
"Bordentown, NJ",9/30/2017,5.0,"One word. Duck pizza. Okay just kidding it's two words.  Pro tip: for all my white girls, the chardonnay saison. Yas girl."
"Fort Washington, PA",6/10/2016,4.0,"Great little brewery/bar/restaurant right in the heart of downtown Yardley. We enjoyed sitting outside and trying a bunch of apps, entrees and a few pitchers of sangria. Highly recommend the buffalo cauliflower, and pizza. Definitely recommend this place!"
"Ringwood, NJ",7/26/2014,4.0,"Beer was outstanding and the food was a pleasant surprise. All the beer is seasonal so stock up on what ya like otherwise you have to wait a year. Looking forward to the Oktoberfest season! Will be back for sure!New chef as of August, no tomato basil soup. :("
"State College, PA",11/28/2015,5.0,"Incredible atmosphere. Good beer. Great food. Live music. Fast service. The vault is a great place for those looking for a low key spot to catch up with friends or take someone on a date. Not for those looking for the ""hottest"" bar in town where everything is immersed in TV screens and pretty girls on their iPhones. Last night was my first time and I would definitely go back again!"
"Washington, DC",5/12/2018,5.0,"Fresh brews and great grub. This place is great for after work libation and dinner, or a midday lunch beer and snack. The service and staff are friendly and attentive. This place has it all."
"Trenton, NJ",5/30/2013,5.0,"My boyfriend and I have been meaning to come here for a few weeks since coming across their website.We sat in the dining area of the brewery and it was tiny, but the tables were spread out appropriately. We'd love to go back and sit at the bar one night too. Although most of the reviews were neutral about the food (selective menu), I was blown away by the quality of the menu. This is food worth eating. We ordered the crab cake sliders, and being one of the most expensive things on the menu (even compared to the sandwiches and flatbreads)-- you knew it had to be good. And they were. The antipasto spread was phenomenal; we got the smaller platter and it was just enough for two people. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly panini and he said it just melted in his mouth. I ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread  (served like a small pizza) it was just delicious. Sprinkled with goat cheese and drizzled with a creme syrup the flavors blended perfectly with every bite. We wanted to try all the beer / wine available so we both ordered our respective flights (beer for him and wine for me) and we were impressed. All local wines, I found my favorite in the seasonal sangria. Another great thing about this place is that the dessert portions are tiny; but rightly priced so there is no excuse for not trying their $2 s'mores. Crazy good. The only con we thought was parking (seemed like street parking only), and also the menu had no substitutions. That was fine by us, because we love trying new foods and exploring new flavors- but someone who is a picky eater might have a hard time finding something they like. All in all, we are so excited to come back here and show off this local gem to our friends and family. Great for big groups- you can order a bunch since they are all small tasting plates"
"Philadelphia, PA",10/29/2015,3.0,"I came here with some friends last weekend.  We waited over an hour for a table for the six of us.  Before we sat down I tried the Sweet Potato beer.  It wasn't great, but it had some interesting flavors.  I tried the margarita pizza for my dinner and it was good.  I wish the pizza wasn't burnt but the flavor were there.  The parking situation is a little shady.  Make sure you park in the lot behind the building across the street otherwise you will get towed."
"Colts Neck, NJ",12/7/2017,5.0,Really good pizza & excellent drinks plus the service is very fine
"Plainsboro Township, NJ",12/28/2016,4.0,"This place is always packed every time I go. It's not very large so it's worth making a reservation to ensure you get a seat. The online reservation system on Yelp works great and sends you a text message when your table is ready. When this place is packed, going down the block to the continental tavern for a beer is a good option which we did. They have between 5-10 beers regularly. You need to check their menu online as its seasonal and the beers aren't always the same. The oatmeal stout is delicious and light. It's only a 5% but it's great. I was told the sweet potato beer and the black IPA (not sure of the name) are both really good also. Service at the vault is great. Our waitress was very attentive and came over regularly to check if we needed anything. After 3 beers, an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert our bill was around $60 for 2 people. It was great and reasonably priced. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and I thought it was going to have honey mustard on it but it turned out to be bbq honey mustard. My mistake but not the taste I was going for. My boo had the duck and apple pie. He loved it!"
"Fairless Hills, PA",8/13/2015,4.0,"The Vault is a quaint restaurant in a converted bank in downtown Yardley. They specialize with craft brews and of course pub food. I went there most recently with my wife and my parents. I found the service good. I want to say it felt like at times people were being a little ""upper crusty"" - hello? Its a bar. They did have some great food! For a started we got the cheese plate and also the antipasta - both were amazing transporting my palette to flavortown (to steal a phrase from Guy Fieri)We decided to go with one of the house specialty pizzas. The waiter suggested the Thai chicken pizza for some spice. My wife wasn't a fan, but my parents and I loved it. My wife also got the turkey sandwich - which is your typical turkey sandwich. My parents also split the BLT salad. That was tasty. I stole a bite. Dessert...OMG the SMORES!! A must order!  Prices were pretty good, but slightly on the higher side. It was about $120 plus tip for the four of us for dinner and apps and dessert."
"Marlton, Evesham Township, NJ",6/25/2017,5.0,"Great place. The beer was delish and so was the food. I ordered the kolsh, my fiancée got a flight with 4 IPA's and one of them was so good (muse), even I ordered it. And I'm not an IPA lover. Servers were very attentive, prompt and friendly. We sat outside and the patio has a really nice feel to it. We'll definitely be back!"
"Crawfordsville, IN",5/7/2017,5.0,"Again I find myself in Trenton New Jersey on a trip. We cross the river to stay in Pennsylvania and dropped by The Vault for dinner.  Very friendly hostess told us we had about a 15 minute wait for a table so we walked up to the bar to make a selection on beer. Bartender was very friendly and helpful. Once seated we were waited on by Hannah, a great young lady who did a fantastic job. We ordered the anti-pasta, a full board, Italian sausage pizza and the crabcake sliders. The full board was more than enough of an appetizer, cheeses were delicious, bread fresh and warm, meat selection excellent. The pizza was in my opinion perfect great crust fresh vegetables and a nice spicy sausage.  By this time I'm stuffed but I went ahead with the crabcake sliders. A nice twist on the slider thing. I tried four of their beers in  a Flight and made a selection on a German wheat and have them fill my growler. Hannah tried to find a sticker for my growler without me asking but couldn't. She helped me out with a small glass though. All in all really enjoyed the place and do recommend stopping by when you're in the area."
"Burlington, NJ",4/3/2017,1.0,"This place is probably okay if your only purpose is to sit and drink beer get plastered and listen to some well off a..hole next to you talk politics all night about crap they know nothing about.  If you simply want a beer and nice meal go somewhere else as you will spend the entire night waiting and don't bring anyone with you that has children. First there are no high chairs and second Yardley anything for them to eat third, well you could watch at least six innings before you get your meal."
"Los Angeles, CA",7/24/2013,4.0,"A gem in the suburbs. Everything was enjoyable, from the live jazz band (7pm-?? on the friday that went) to the food to the beer. Food - If you are only going to order one item, get the brown sugar buffalo pizza. AMAZING. Your tastebuds will be in for a ride. If you're going to get other items get the crab cake sliders (fo sho) and the braised pork belly. The lamb meatballs was a little dry...wouldn't order it again. However, end the night with a s'more. If you're thinking ""s'mores?! But I can make that at home! or at a bonfire on the beach!"" Well my answer would be, ""Can you really make a homemade s'more with BEER-infused marshmallow that will instantly make your tastebuds swoon for only $2?! Yea, that's what I thought."" Beer - They have a beer flight option. My fav is the red ale. Service was average. It was really the food and atmosphere that gave this place a high rating. Definitely a place to take the parents.Another note: they don't take reservations but you can call 30 minutes before you get there to reserve."
"Ewing Township, NJ",10/9/2017,4.0,Casual with delicious food and love the variety of beers.  The menu didn't have a lot on it but we shared a mushroom pizza and brisket sandwich and they both were absolutely amazing.
"Drexel Hill, PA",4/24/2016,5.0,"Excellent service and food here. I love that there is outside seating. I enjoyed myself trying s few different items off of the menu. I had the wild mushroom pizza, pork belly fries and a sangria. I like to taste a little bit of everything. I never know if I'll be back in the area of a new restaurant. Pizza was awesome! I love the truffle ricotta cheese. The fingerling fries were good with the garlic aioli. Sangria was good too, not too sweet. Overall I would recommend it and come back sometime"
"Jackson, NJ",5/20/2013,4.0,"Recently discovered this place after seeing a number of friends checking in on Foursquare. Well worth the trip since they have done a great job as far as their beer offerings along with a rather nice menu, which is constantly being changed and improved. My wife had a glass of wine which was marginal, at best and I had the beer flight and then a full glass. The beers are quite good, but then, that is why I came in the first place.Parking can be a challenge but we found a spot in the lot behind the brewery which is not clearly marked. There were also some spots on the main street which we passed up while looking for the building.We will be back to try their food - the brown sugar buffalo pizza sounds like a winner!"
"Langhorne, PA",8/19/2018,5.0,"Love the the Vault is dog friendly! The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable about the different beers. Tell them what you do and don't like and let them give suggestions, you won't be sorry."
"Memphis, TN",3/9/2016,5.0,"I walked in and it was PACKED...on a Tuesday Night.  I figured that must be a good sign.I orederd a flight, well, three beers of the flight and told the bartender to pick the fourth beer.  She was on point, and gave me another one based on what I ordered and it fit right in...They also do a beer called Trial and Error, they try something, have the people trying it vote on it and then decide if they will do it based on the crowd.  And, it's priced based on how they think that it will go.Now, that's fun!!  I will have to come back to this place the next time I'm in town and give the food a try, as the menu looked good as well."
"Malvern, PA",7/5/2015,3.0,"Went with my wife daughter and her two young children. Not exactly a kid friendly locale-not that they advertise as such. I think it was the cranky waitress. Really didn't seem like she wanted to be working. We switched to outdoors and things improved.Kale salad was primo. How do they get that kale so tender? Thai chicken pizza and plain for kids both tasty and good crust. Our 6yo crust expert approved.  Crab sliders were full of crab. Too much roll maybe?Anyway, places need to be a little flexible. Don't tell me I can't get plain fries for kids when you have fries on the menu. This is a brewery, not Vetri. I'd go back but not w cranky waitress gal."
"Princeton, NJ",9/24/2016,4.0,"The Vault is a gastro-brewpub situated in an old bank that does just about everything right. However, their success just might be their downfall.The beer - there were seven different craft beers on tap on our recent visit. We started with a flight so we could sample them all. Of the seven, three were ales crafted with wild yeast, and the rest included a dunkelweizen, a stout,  a Belgian blonde, and an IPA. The latter three were excellent. The dunkelweizen was just OK, and the three ales, while good, were pretty similar. Given the brewmaster's touch with the stout, I am very much looking forward to their Russian Imperial Stout which was going to be available in a few weeks.The food - the kitchen is open, and you can see the cooking team working hard to keep up with the orders. We started with the Pad Thai Popcorn, which was tasty and inspired, bursting with cilantro. I understand how others have complained about the portion size, because it was so good we could have eaten two orders easily. We saw several orders of the hummus board trio go by, but we didn't have enough time to try it (more about that later). The wild mushroom flatbread was very good, with a charred and slightly chewy crust covered with a good mix of roasted mushrooms and onions, and topped with a handful of spicy arugula (which could have been cut into just a little smaller, bite-sized pieces). The ambiance - the room is balanced by the seven large brewing vessels and bar on the one side and the open kitchen on the other. There are interesting antique implements of the banking trade placed around the building. There are no TVs, and the music is definitely not top 40. The live jazz on Friday & Saturday nights brings in a good mix of local and NYC-based acts. Acoustics are good, but there are limited sightlines to the ""stage,"" which is very small and appears to be only 8 inches off the floor: this is not the Blue Note. The service however was friendly, quick, and efficient. The servers we had were also knowledgeable about the beer, which is often not the case at other brewpubs. We were also given the offer (without asking) of sampling a couple of the local wines before choosing.The worst thing about the Vault is their seating policy. They don't take reservations, but instead offer the option to call an hour ahead of your arrival, but that still didn't help us that Saturday night with the live jazz. We called promptly at 6, and arrived at 7, after searching for parking as the lot out back was full, as were all the street spots. The hostess tried to sell us by saying that people who had not called ahead were looking at a wait longer than an hour and a half after arriving, while ours would be only 30 minutes. After about an hour and 15 minutes of standing at a shared table in the crowded bar area, we were were finally seated, the two of us at a four-top."
"Morrisville, PA",6/11/2018,1.0,Not very welcoming. I went into the restaurant on Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend. The place wasn't very busy but all of the seats at the bar were taken.  The majority of the tables were empty. I asked the hostess if we could be seated and mentioned we were there just for drinks. She said the seats were only for customers ordering food. I told her all of the seats at the bar full. What should we do? She told us to go stand in the corner and drink. This really happened! We left and went to the Continental instead.
"Lawrence Township, NJ",9/9/2017,4.0,"First timer here. Came in for a Friday night something different wanted a brew pub. Service and atmosphere is great. We got there early which is good because as I was told by a local, you won't get a seat.We sat at a high top and saw all the food coming out, looks tremendous. People say the pizza is to die for. Didn't want pizza, so we went with the salami and cheese platter, cucumber gazpacho, the brisket sandwhich and the cuban.Everything was awesome. The cuban was a little salty, and the mustard overpowered the meat and cheese. The brisket was great.Did a flight of beer. Not a hoppy beer person, but everyone else in the world is so I found some that were not so hoppy. The Stout was tremendous.Then a band came on a 7 which was a surprise.  Our waitress was great will go again."
"Alexandria, VA",11/15/2015,4.0,"The perfect date night out! My husband and I had a great time trying out a few different beers and enjoyed the unique pizzas. We started out with a couple beers with the Hummus platter and Antipasto board for appetizers then moved on to the Brown Sugar Buffalo Pizza and the Steak Frites Pizza. By the time we got the end, we were so full we had to skip dessert! The hostess (Melissa) was very gracious and even replaced a beer for me when I made the mistake of ordering without tasting it first. Overall, it was a very positive experience and a great date night. Two cons: With the volume they experience, Vault DOES NOT TAKE RESERVATIONSAlso, be prepared to wait up to an hour for a table. We ended being seated faster because we shared a table with another couple."
"Boston, MA",7/7/2018,5.0,"I'm now a regular here. Beer always excellent, never had an entree I didn't enjoy (favorite has to be the waffle grilled cheese), and I really like that they have monthly specials for additional options. Equally important for me are atmosphere and friendly service, and they typically excel here too."
"Morrisville, PA",4/29/2016,3.0,This is a interesting place. Nice menu and beer list. An old bank building converted to a restaurant is a unique reuse of space.
"Highland Park, NJ",10/15/2015,2.0,"We visited with a friend who grew up near Yardley. He remembered some good beers, but nothing about the food - which was pretty disappointing, as was the service. We sat on the patio and was served by a rather unenthusiastic waitress. Favouring IPA's, we ordered the 5C's and the English, as the others on the menu weren't available. We thought the 5C's was interesting but a little fruity and the English was pretty good.We ordered the Pork Belly Fries to start and the Italian Sausage Pizza to share. The fries didnt seem fresh and there was a serious lack of pork - probably 3-4 small bites for the dish of fries and cheese. The waitress didn't explain the dips on either end, but they were nice. After waiting for our pizza and server for 45 minutes, we asked the hostess to check on our pizza. 15 minutes later, our server came out with our pizza and said: ""Sorry, the kitchen is understaffed"" The pizza was ok, but neither the crust nor the minced toppings would make us order it again. Perhaps this we visited on an off night, but both the food and the service were lacking."
"Newtown, PA",10/23/2015,5.0,"Just what Yardley needed!!! The old bank still shows every fascinating detail of the historical bank it once was.  The servers work From the old cashiers counter...the entrance has all the security boxes still there and of course the vault takes you right back to a feeling of being transported in time.!!! Now the beer is yummy!  My favorite wasThe Belgium Wit until everyone drank it up!!!  The menu is light fare and absolutely fabulous.  I love the pizza, the cold meat board, the hummus plate and so on.  The servings are generous so enjoy your beer, share your food plates and enjoy a laugh with friends.Since it opened it has been the ""meet me there"" place for me with friends.  The patio is great and the vault room has a zen theme which i find fun and funky!The only problem as it is inMost of Yardley is the parking challenge at night when Yardley is busy.   But hey! Walking a few steps to park is healthy and not a big deal... The parking is there but unfortunately it seems some businesses arent playing nice... Dont give up....theres a  parking spot for you.If you want a change of pace with super beers and food and a light party pub atmosphere, hurry over to the Vault."
"Townsend, DE",8/22/2017,4.0,"Beer was great, food was great. Sat outside on the patio. The inside was pretty cool with it being an old bank. I'm visiting from out of town, but I would definitely go back."
"West Orange, NJ",7/29/2018,5.0,"What's not to love?!?! The ambiance is chill and classy. The food is incredible. Seriously, everything I have ever eaten here is amazing. Drinks are fantastic. The Vault is a must!"
"Philadelphia, PA",7/28/2018,3.0,Went here recently with my family for my birthday. I was excited for them to try it. The food was all really great but i was so disappointed that they had NOTHING on tap but IPA's! Literally every beer was an IPA except 1 porter. No one in my party of 7 likes IPA's so most of us ordered wine. Just disappointing for a brewery to have such a crappy selection.
"Feasterville, PA",4/4/2016,4.0,"Stopped back in again recently to try some new beers and have some food.  This place has FINALLY gotten really, really great.  Had both the buffalo pizza and breakfast pizza, which really, both were 5 stars.  Also had the galaxy pale ale and breakfast stout - the pale ale was excellent, and the stout was good, but still lacking that special something that would make me want to order another immediately.  I've been hyper critical of this place since it first opened, but I feel that these guys have really stepped up and brought it.  Really can't wait for their expansion.  Sign me up, I'm a convert."
"Croydon, PA",8/20/2017,5.0,"One of my favorite breweries & I'm obsessed with the brown sugar buffalo pizza & buffalo cauliflower. That's my go-to. I've pretty much had everything on the menu and am never disappointed. Only downside is waiting on weekends, but that's to be expected at a small, really good place like this. A little pricey, but not knocking stars off because it's worth it."
"Morrisville, PA",2/21/2015,3.0,"Okay it's complicated...I'll start on a positive note- the food here is some of the best in the area. The pizzas are delicious - I'm really enjoying the new curry chicken pizza. Sandwiches are great, I love the fresh pita bread with appetizer plates and the side salads are super fresh. (Whatever the dressing is... Oh yum)The beer is super tasty and offers a wide selection from IPAs to stouts on nitro and blondes! My favorite is the sweet potato ale on nitro during the fall. The Aussie Black is one of my new favorites too.Negative- the service here is horrible. Waitresses on SEVERAL occasions have forgotten to put my order in. One time we were the only table in the restaurant! One night, I was waiting for my take out for over 45 minutes. Meanwhile, it was given to the bartender who 'forgot' to let me know it was ready. Last night was the icing on the cake- my boyfriend and I were seated by our waitress and given menus. After 15 minutes we still hadn't seen our server to order a beer so we left. Hopefully the service greatly improves and caters to the delicious food and beer offered!"
"Morrisville, PA",1/6/2016,4.0,"This place is great! The sweet potato ale is not to be missed... it's like everything you wanted in pumpkin beer but were sadly and expectedly disappointed in. Pros: That sweet potato ale. The food is really great - a fresh, sharable, changing menu, with cute date-night food. Good prices for a trendy pub. Great lighting and scenery / ambiance. Excellent for taking friends or a date to. Last and best, the beers are quality.Cons: It's pretty much always packed, and it's almost always 30-45 minute wait for a table during peak dinner hours. They don't take reservations. It's very small inside, so in cold months, the outdoor seating is closed and you basically have about a dozen functional tables. Great spot, I wish I were able to go more and get a table. ;)"
"Levittown, PA",2/14/2015,1.0,Update:the restaurant manager Chris did an outstanding job addressing our concerns and the saving grace was the food which was fantastic.  We will be back again and hope this was an anomaly. This kitchen is slowwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!! Worst over an hour waiting on food and it's half empty.  Waitress asked if we wanted desert we told her we didn't get our meal yet
"Brentsville, VA",9/17/2015,4.0,"This place had an awesome presence and awesome food. Walking up to the building you can see the rustic look of the old bank it used to be and walking in is even cooler. There are old vaults that they used to hold alcohol and the style of the old bank is still very much present.First time there so I had to try a flight, and I have to say, each beer was pretty good in its own way. I could even handle the robust dark beer, which I usually can't handle dark beer but it had its own unique flavor.Starters, my boyfriend ordered the pork belly fries and I ordered the gazpacho soup. Both were excellent, the truffle sauce with the pork belly fries was to die for! I've only had the traditional gazpacho, so this yellow one was a twist for me, I liked it a lot and it was a healthy, fresh soup.For dinner my boyfriend got the chicken sandwich which I just had a bite of and it seemed pretty tasty. I ordered the crab cake sliders, which I'm sad to say were just alright. They definitely were all crab and tasted fresh, but I think the sandwich was as a whole, too dry. Definitely could've used more sauce on it, or even a side of something....dare I say.... the truffle sauce that came with the pork belly!!! The service was fine, everyone was friendly nothing to write home about. All in all I will be back to try those pizzas because, why not?"
"Trenton, NJ",2/15/2014,4.0,"Had the Sherry crab bisque, very good!Cozy atmosphere and attentive service. Will be back for sure."
"Philadelphia, PA",12/22/2014,4.0,"This place has kind of an identity crisis.  This converted bank, full of a mish mosh of different styles, all adds up to one charming experience.  They don't have reservations, but they have a call ahead list.  Our wait was about 30 minutes, but that just means we got to sample their brews before sitting down.It is not a large menu, but we still had a hard time deciding because there were multiple items that looked good.  We tried the thai popcorn and the buffalo cauliflower for starters. Both were good.  I got the cuban sandwich and it was maybe one of the better cubans I have had north of Tampa.  They don't have fries here - all sides come with a side salad.  I actually loved my little side salad and didn't miss the extra calories.We mostly ordered the citra IPA and were very happy with it.  It is a straight forward IPA without too much bitterness or hops.  I loved it.The waitress was as charming as the atmosphere.  We all had a great evening and wished we lived closer."
"Fairless Hills, PA",4/10/2016,5.0,I love this place. The Margarita Pie is so good and the sauce is what makes it my fave!Great service and atmosphere!
"Morrisville, PA",5/20/2017,5.0,"Great place to hang out, nice vibe and atmosphere. If you make it through your 4th brew? You'll understand why I call it ""funky, cold medina""! At least the Mrs. knows!"
"Chicago, IL",7/13/2017,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience at this beautiful, ambient restaurant! We shared three pizzas- The wild mushroom, sausage, and margarita. Service was great, food came fast. Didn't try the beer flights but they looked amazing. Definitely go!"
"Hazlet, NJ",1/14/2016,4.0,"Really good pizza, great beer choices, excellent ambience and just a neat place to enjoy all of the aforementioned. This was stop number 4 on our tour, so we definitely needed some grub, and the Vault has some good grub. Enjoyed a couple of wheat beers, with my boys. Solid place."
"Saint Louis, MO",7/9/2017,4.0,I really enjoy going to this delicious little pizza joint. I recommend both the pizzas and the beers to everyone. They once had a sweet potato ale that was delicious. My favorite is the duck and apple pizza. The taco pizza and Cuban sandwich are also good as well.
"Cranbury, NJ",10/10/2015,5.0,"While working, me and my buddy decided to start the  weekend early on Thursday and ended up at this place at 4pm. Withing 15 mins we both were posting pictures of beer and the place on our friends group chat.The freshest beer you will have!! You can actually see the brew master make beer in front of you.Great beer, good people and good food. What else do you need?"
"Morrisville, PA",4/25/2017,5.0,"We recently went to Vault for my son's Birthday, we had eight people in our party. I had called ahead, but they did not offer call ahead seating. My daughter and I arrived about 30 minutes ahead of our group, and were seated immediately. The staff was very gracious and accommodating. We ordered the hummus plate as well as the buffalo cauliflower, both were delicious. We also ordered three different  brick oven pizzas, margarita, sausage and chili, all three were very good. Would recommend Vault to anyone who enjoy craft beer and great pizza!"
"Trenton, NJ",6/18/2018,5.0,"We frequent the Vault for lunch and recently held my daughters baby shower in the back bar.  The food, drink, and atmosphere were spectacular.  Fan favorites were the pork belly fries, crab cakes, and the selection of pizza.  I worked with Jackie during the event planning and she also managed the bar and food during the shower.  Jackie went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure everything was just right.  We plan on returning for lunch and would also highly recommend the Vault for a private party."
"Manalapan Township, NJ",5/6/2015,1.0,"I was so excited to visit Vault , until I sat down and waited and waited for them to get our order. About 15 minutes later the waitress came over and took our beer order , the waitress really didn't know about the beers they have so we just ordered a flight to make the decision our selfs. Then the waiter came over to take our food order about 5 minutes later, for some reason the food came out before the beer which was placed about 20 minutes prior to ordering our food. The employees were not that friendly and did not really bring that come eat here kinda feeling. Very disappointed in this visit"
"Glenside, PA",1/17/2016,5.0,"Absolutely delicious! The duck confit pizza is a must try! It was sweet and savory with a perfect crust. What a combination, take a chance you won't be sorry.Cuban sandwich perfected with chorizo and excellent brisket sandwich crunchy bread soft filling with tasty cheese.We'll be back and bring friends!"
"Franklin Park, NJ",11/2/2015,5.0,Great food and even better beer.  I highly recommend the buffalo pizza with pancetta and the buffalo cauliflower.  And you can't go wrong with any of their beer! Looking forward to going back on a night when they have live Jazz.
"Pennington, NJ",2/8/2018,4.0,Love this place. Food and service is always good. The wait is sometimes long and they don't have French fries. What kind of place doesn't have French fries?
"Philadelphia, PA",9/5/2014,5.0,"I went to Vault on a Saturday afternoon around one PM and found it to be pleasantly lazy inside. My friend and I were there for the tour (includes a flight of what's on tap, and you get to keep the glass), which hadn't gotten started yet. While we waited, I ordered a pint, which I didn't have time to pay for before the tour (we sat at the bar). The bartender very kindly put some reserved signs on our seats and we moved along.Richard, the employee who does the tours, is extremely knowledgeable about the brewing process (as he should be) and the chemistry behind making beer. Everything he said to us was on point and was delivered without being condescending. There was ample time for questions and he explained every beer we drank in detail. Everything about this tour was well-thought-out and segued well into the next point. This was honestly the best tour of a brewery that I have ever been on. Kudos.After the tour, we sat down and drank a good amount of beer and ate a lot of food. I really enjoyed the duck and apple flatbread (large enough for two), which also had carmelized onions. We also got a small cup of the dark chocolate stout pudding, which was decadent. As for the beer... everything they make is in fairly small batches, as they're a microbrewery, and only some are bottled, so everything is super-fresh. They also have a lot of turnover with the varieties they serve at any given time-- the best brews on tap when I was there were the saison (funky, spicy, and fresh. Exactly what a saison should be) and the coffee stout (on nitro, thick and almost velvety). In short, all of the brews I tried were excellent."
"Old Town Alexandria, Alexandria, VA",6/3/2015,4.0,"Vault is an establishment that could easily be worth making the trip for.The brewpub is in an old bank, and still has all the trappings. (Including the original namesake vault, which you can go check out) It's elegant and feels more like a wine bar than a brew pub, which most likely leads to a sense of confusion. We went here on a Friday night, and a live funky jazz group was playing. Again, weird choice of music for a brew pub.Despite the odd environment, it's a cozy and beautiful establishment. Great high top tables outside with heat lamps give it a great outdoor drinking experience, and the small selection of beers were all excellent. (I tried the sampler, and enjoyed everything I tasted) I settled on the stout, which was light and full bodied; It's an infrequent event that I put down multiple stouts in a row, but It was the clear winner amongst the selections.The pork belly fries were good, if unspectacular. Big rich cuts of potato and fancy mayo sauce, the table really enjoyed them and cleaned up. On the whole, Vault is an excellent experience. If it feels snooty, it's best to remember the neighborhood (and target audience) of the location. It hits all the right notes, and is a unique addition to the Yardley streets."
"Springfield, MA",11/5/2016,3.0,"Have been to Vault several times and have always been pleased with the food. Although last evening (11/4/16), the service was horrific. We were taken to a table after an 80 minute wait - that wasn't the issue. The table and one chair were wet and we had to find someone to clean it up. After another 5 minutes our waitress came over and asked if we wanted drinks, but when we said no, she just closed her book and walked away, not asking if we were ready to order. After our appetizers came and were cleared, she came back to ask if we wanted dessert or our check. Of course, none of us had received our entrees. We spent almost 3-1/2 hours from the time we entered until we left. I hope service will improve."
"Langhorne, PA",3/22/2017,5.0,Really solid brewery. Has a very nice atmosphere inside. The menu is interesting and everything I have had so far has been really good. The beer is very well done. I've tried about 10+ of their beers and haven't been disappointed yet. Friendly staff. Great system online for reserving cans when they're released. Can't wait to see more cans coming out of here
"Levittown, PA",5/15/2017,5.0,"An outstanding brewpub, featuring quality craft brews of its own making and food that is sourced locally.  Live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights and deck seating in warmer months."
"Yardley, PA",5/12/2018,5.0,"Good beer, great specialty pizzas, and a really cool spot to grab a drink. Live music, two bars, and micro brew six packs and growlers to go - good stuff all around."
"Morrisville, PA",5/7/2017,4.0,A great local Brew Pub! Consistently great Brews as well as local wines. Food selections are refreshing and unique to the area.
"Nashville, TN",3/17/2015,5.0,"Thanks to yelp, I keep eating at great restaurants.  This place is located inside an old bank and is very charming.  We had the buffalo cauliflower and coconut chicken curry pizza which was awesome!!!  They have a great beer selection too."
"Morrisville, PA",11/10/2015,3.0,Maybe it was an off night but when we went the servers seemed to be coming at us from all sides. The table we were at was in the middle of everything! The building was very cool as was the bar area. The food was pretty good. I had the brisket sandwich which needed something on the side. As a side note... What the heck are people doing bringing kids in the there? Little kids. Nothing like a 7pm Friday dinner & brews to the tune of $70 while toddlers cry and run around. Even at the outdoor bar area we couldn't get around the strollers.
"Newtown, PA",6/5/2015,5.0,"Every time i come here I love itInside, outside, in the bar areaLove it all. The food is great and fresh, service great, ambience greatWe generaly come on Fridays at happy hour time"
"Langhorne, PA",3/4/2017,5.0,"This place was lovely - great selections, interesting flavors, the staff was super helpful all around , nice atmosphere, very enjoyable experience- can't wait to go back!"
"Evesham Township, NJ",8/9/2015,5.0,Great atmosphere. We sat at a high top table near the open kitchen and watched all the food as it came out of the pizza oven.  Every last thing looked delicious.  The head chef was meticulous about presentation.  We tried the buffalo cauliflower.  It was incredible!
"Chappaqua, NY",12/28/2016,4.0,"Great spot in such a quaint town! Draft beers are excellent and cocktails are great too. I was surprised at the quality of their menu items- something you would expect to travel to travel to the city for but right here in Yardley. Highly recommended though it gets packed after happy hour, make reservations in advance"
"Mahopac, NY",6/26/2016,2.0,"Pretentious. Unacommodating.  Don't come with kids. The only thing they will be able to eat is cheese pizza or a burger. No soda. No iced tea. Beer meh. All food is pre-mixed/pre-Made, so can't ask to not put hot sauce in an appetizer, etc. If you are coming for pizza and a beer, could be ok."
"Bristol, RI",10/21/2015,5.0,Always a favorite place to take friends and relatives when they visit!Great food. Awesome service.
"Somerville, MA",12/6/2014,5.0,"Finally! A place in Yardley to bring your beer snob friends! Ok in all seriousness, I love that the beer offerings constantly change to reflect the seasons. The food menu is fantastic as well! Also seasonal, I pretty much always leave sad that I couldn't just eat EVERYTHING on the menu."
"Brooklyn, NY",11/13/2016,4.0,We stopped here for a local birthday lunch as we were in PA for the weekend. Vault was a pretty cute and unexpected find in Yardley. The Pizzas were good (especially the mushroom) and I enjoyed my beer flight. They also have growlers for you to take home. The service was pleasant and friendly. Would definitely return when in the area.
"Morrisville, PA",1/14/2017,4.0,"Came in for a date on a snowy Saturday evening.  I was a little confused as to how to park behind the building, so I opted to park across the street.  That was my only 'issue' with the restaurant, if you can even call it that, since it is my own error.  It's basically just a forewarning to figure out where you want to park!The ambiance in the restaurant is very chill, lighting is very cozy, and their was a band playing in area by the bar.  We were seated right in front on the actual vault, which was pretty cool.  We both ordered the margarita pizza.  At first I wasn't too impressed with it, I think because it wasn't pipping hot when I ate it.  But let me tell you, when I got home, and reheated it - it was bomb.  I'm just one of those people that isn't super into warm/room temperature pizza, so I don't think that would be a tick off of anyone's list but my own.  So, I would definitely go back again.  I mean, I have to - there is a s'mores dessert on the menu!The menu itself was very unique and offered more than just pizza.  I hope my review will give you the extra little push to go try it out!"
"Lower Makefield, PA",12/4/2016,5.0,"I don't drink alcohol but give the vault one of the highest scores in town for food quality, atmosphere, service and management. The cheese and hummus boards are great as are the artisan pizzas."
"Bayonne, NJ",1/7/2018,5.0,"Vault Brewing was hands down one of the best places I have ever eaten at. First let's start with the beer. I got the sweet potato ale and it was absolutely amazing. It was so perfectly balanced and enjoyable. For an appetizer we got the pretzel braid. My friends and I usually always get a pretzel appetizer if it's an option when we go out, so believe me we have had our fair share of pretzels. My friend said it was easily the best pretzel she had ever had. I know I know, something so simple like a pretzel is hard to screw up but this one was just so perfectly baked and the beer cheese was a great addition. For entrees we got the hummus platter, the buffalo brown sugar pizza, and the waffle grilled cheese. Every item was phenomenal. The buffalo pizza is hands down one of the best meals of my life. Seriously, whoever thought of combining these flavors is a genius! The hummus trio was great each flavor was great and the pita and vegetables were good compliments to it. The waffle grilled cheese was another amazing item that who would think to put them together!!! The waffle was so light and airy and delicious and the cheeses used were amazing! For dessert we got the wood fired s'mores which was a great small size cause we were very full after everything we had eaten, but there's always room for dessert. Vault is seriously a great find and you must stop if you're in the area. Great food, great beer, great service, what more can you ask for."
"Newtown, PA",9/19/2016,4.0,"First time here and enjoyed.  It wasn't very busy when we went (3ish on a Tuesday) so we got the place essentially to ourselves. The decor was great, but still casual. We had a lovely fruity beer and the food was pretty good. Menu isn't extensive, but seems to cover the basics.. Pizza and sandwiches. We will defiantly visit again."
"Morrisville, PA",2/3/2018,4.0,"Love the breakfast stout, pork belly fries, antipasto board, and wild mushroom pizza. Went on a Saturday evening and was seated faster than they predicted. Great service at both the bar and a table, beautiful location and gorgeous interior. Decent wine menu. But I'd skip the s'mores. They sound better than they taste."
"Hatfield, PA",10/27/2014,5.0,"I checked this place out on Saturday night and had an AWESOME time. We ( my bf and friend) showed up at 6:30 with no reservation, and lucked out with a high top table in the bar area. The waiter was very knowledgeable about their beer selection, and despite how busy they were, was very attentive. We were sitting next to where all the food comes out, and I have to say, Everything looked delicious. Very Clean, and you could tell the guys making our food were working hard to get everything out perfectly. My favorite beer was the Sweet Potato beer that was on ""NITRO"" so it poured like Guinness, and I normally am allergic to most beer, but this beer worked out, and was DELICIOUS!! (no preservatives, no additives) The Mushroom flat-bread is a must, and the sandwiches were served with a lovely side of Greens, definitely a great value!!The GM Chris stopped by our table ;) and indulged us with dessert and suggestions for bottles to take home (since I was surprisingly having NO allergic reactions to their beer) and it was nice to be personally welcomed as new customers. This is definitely a new favorite place of mine, and would suggest this to anyone who likes good beer, food, and atmosphere!PS There was live Jazz at 8:30 on the Saturday I went :) +++"
"Hamilton Township, NJ",8/23/2014,4.0,Great !! Love their brown sugar buffalo pizza and their beer soaked s'mores ! Must go spot
"Morrisville, PA",3/18/2017,3.0,Parking a problem. Restaurant food passable but not great. A little dark for my tastes. Nothing special about this place.
"Morrisville, PA",3/16/2018,3.0,Food is very good with fun options. My husband loves the beer. Wish they treated non- beer drinkers better. Tiny pours and inflated prices on mediocre wine.
"Trenton, NJ",1/15/2018,4.0,"The duck pizza is great. I wish there was more bar seating. Good food, good beer, good vibes."
"Cherry Hill, NJ",6/16/2017,2.0,"Great atmosphere at the Vault!  But the food was just okay.  We started with fingerling potatoes - they were the best thing we had and I wish we ordered 2 bowls.  My husband liked his salad.  I ordered the hummus trio.  The pita was very good and warm.  I only liked the taste of the black bean hummus - tasty and just a little spicy.  The other 2 tasted weird.  Not sure what spice was used.  I love hummus so typically, I like all versions.  My oldest ordered the waffle grilled cheese - very hard to eat.  Could not pick it up and eat it as it fell apart.  Messy and just okay re: flavor.  My other child ordered the margherita pizza.  She didn't love it.  The flavor was off.  Not sure why.  Just not the best.  So, I guess if you want beer (because it seemed like they have a lot of that), this would be a good place to go.  But the menu was just okay and definitely not geared towards kids.  Some odd spice combos."
"Trenton, NJ",12/20/2015,4.0,Really good food. Comes out so quick it's amazing. The prices for drinks are a little High $8.00 for a glass of wine is steep imo. We will go back for the pizza and the buffalo cauliflower.
"Philadelphia, PA",9/29/2016,5.0,"This place is nice. Real nice. The setup, the layout, the atmosphere. It's perfect for going right after work or going for a semi formal yet informal dinner. The food is really good. The duck and apple pizza is a must if you go! And it's a brewing company with a very good selection so the beers great too. My recommendation would be the sweet potato ale. It's definitely different but really refreshing and somewhat light. A lot of good options for food and drink to pick from here."
"Egg Harbor City, NJ",9/6/2016,4.0,"Really enjoyed my visit to the Vault Brewing Company on my way home after spending the day in New Hope. The place is nice with a small outdoor section. We had a table in the dining area that was near the kitchen, which actually provided some entertainment watching them make the pizza. We didn't have the pizza but it sure looked good. We wanted something light so we got the hummus trio. The board came out with three scoops of different hummus (garlic, white bean, and black bean) which were all really tasty. But that wasn't all, it also had plenty of vegetables and pita bread for dipping. Needless to say we were actually quit full by the time we finished it. I had two beers, the New Zealand IPA which I though was good and the Kolsch which I really enjoyed. The service was a little uneven on the day we went but apparently they were short staffed due to the holiday. Still found most of the staff to be friendly and our food and drinks came out timely."
"Oreland, PA",8/9/2014,3.0,"Went on a Friday night for dinner with friends.  Even though it was crowded at 9pm we were seated relatively quickly (call ahead seating).  The beers were decent, but you can go to Ratebeer.com for detailed beer reviews.  Food was tasty and served in a decent amount of time.  Two quirks though - the waitress really pushed the chips instead of a salad on a couple of friends (""I'd definitely go with the chips"" is what she said).  Thinking they'd be some in house kettle cooked chips they went with them.  Nope - just bagged chips.  I got the salad with mine and the ""balsamic dressing"" that I asked for was 90% flavorless oil with no vinegar flavor.  It should have been listed as a ""vinegar and oil"" dressing, not balsamic - and it should have had some seasoning or flavor.  Otherwise it was just a cup of slippery on my greens.About 1/3 of their menu items have caramelized onions on them.  I tried to order their wild mushroom flat-bread and asked for it with no onions and was told no.  They can't take anything off the dishes.  I can understand no substitutions, but unless that flat-bread is pre-made and frozen why on earth do they HAVE to make it with onions.  I had to settle on something else because there was very little selection that didn't have onions.  Good live music (at least when we were here - YMMV).  Would go again if in the area, but would not drive far out of my way to go here."
"Chatham Township, NJ",2/13/2017,4.0,"Wound up here by accident and am very glad we did. The beer was amazing and our bacon and broccoli pizza was delicious. Disappointing that the only growler they had was $20 before the fill, absolutely ridiculous, but it was otherwise a fantastic experience."
"Easton, PA",1/27/2015,5.0,"This place is amazing, the food is great and the fact that they brew there own beer and buy as local as possible is a huge plus in my book. And since this place is amazing there will usually be a wait that can't be helped, no use complaining. I love the fact that the restaurant itself used to be a bank and they kept a lot of the charm from the bank. I recommend the pork belly banh mi, I've had these sandwiches in philly at the Asian market and they did a great job! And they also have a vegetarian version of it to. This place is great for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Also try the buffalo cauliflower appetizer."
"North Wales, PA",11/28/2016,5.0,"Absolutely loved this place! We came here around happy hour on a Saturday in the fall. It was a little chilly, but we sat outside anyway because we loved the outdoor seating area and once they turned the space heaters on, it was perfect! We each ordered a flight and loved every sample. The sweet potato beer was my favorite. Really unique flavor! We also ordered the pork belly fries as well as the chili & pita appetizer. Both were out of this world good. The food is a tad on the expensive side, but totally worth it. Huge step above your average bar food. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing night out in a cool atmosphere or a quick happy hour stop!"
"Morrisville, PA",1/21/2018,4.0,"Delicious salads and soups! Great service, too. This is a great place to meet friends in downtown Yardley."
"Southampton, PA",7/24/2014,3.0,"Not bad!The restaurant is very pretty and trendy inside, with a small stage set aside for live music.We opted to sit outside. To our surprise, there was a Steel Drum player! The first 15 minutes of listening to him play in the background was fun and different, but as we listened more and more, I could tell that he wasn't really playing anything, and was just making stuff up as he went. A little girl was sitting near him with her father, and he played a song from the Little Mermaid for her, which was cute. But 20 minutes is long enough to listen to a Steel Drum. It would have been different if there were some other instruments.We ordered a flight and were very happy with every beer we tasted! I ordered the Hummus platter as my entre, and I was VERY happy with it. The Cranberry Hummus and Wasabi Hummus were amazing. I've never had anything like it. Boyfriend was disappointed with his burger and salad. Mostly because the ""salad dressing"" was a container with plain oil. I agree that it should have at least been oil and vinegar or something. He wasn't offered any other dressing choices, either."
"Fort Worth, TX",12/26/2013,2.0,"The second I walked in this place I was rooting for it. Great ambiance for a Sunday afternoon.  The service was very good and we started off nicely with some great beer and the cheeseboard- a must try. Then came the entrees. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews so I knew what to order. My husband had the short rib sandwich which he said was ok. I had the Cured salmon Salad which was in the top 5 worst things I ever ate. DO NOT order this. The only good thing on that plate were the beets. The quinoa tasted bland, the salmon like bait fish left out in the sun, dressing so bland it was pointless except to help kill the taste of the fish, and the pea leaves were bitter. I had to eat the chips off my husbands plate to kill the horrid taste left in my mouth. I regret not ordering something people recommended. I would go back if only to convince myself that my initial instincts were not off."
"Philadelphia, PA",1/9/2018,5.0,"Great local spot so glad they opened in our area. Love the buffalo chicken pizza, love the atmosphere & love the sweet potato ale"
"Philadelphia, PA",1/9/2018,5.0,I really love this place as my friend and I always go here. We have made this our hang out spot as the food is always unique and freshly prepared.
"NJ, NJ",7/12/2016,5.0,"Best spot in Yardley! My husband and I are new to the area and we go to this bar on the regular. All of the food so far has been great. My favorites are the Farm Fresh Pizza, which is ridiculous, the pita and hummus app, and the pita and chili app. My husband is always happy with the beer selection and I'm comfortable with the wines, although the selection is limited. I could use a nice Pinot Grigio (hint, hint!). Great outdoor seating for the summer and live music for those that enjoy it!"
"Haworth, NJ",7/28/2016,4.0,Found this place via Yelp. It's a brewery with some nice gastropub style food. The place was crowded on a Wednesday night but I was lucky to get a seat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and provided me a menu right away. I ordered the Mosaic craft beer and several apps. The beer and food were fantastic. I really enjoyed my experience here and would come back again.
"Philadelphia, PA",9/6/2016,4.0,Very cool atmosphere - great food and drinks! Will definitely return. One drawback is not much waiting standing room and they get pretty crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.
"Sewell, NJ",5/2/2014,3.0,"Mostly satisfied.  A group of 4 of us went on a Friday night around 7. There was a 20 min wait.  No prob. They took our cell #and text when our table was ready.  Got drinks at the bar while waiting for our table.  Loved the live music.  Bartenders were kind if snobby when we asked about their beers. Got seated and order probably half of the menu.  Food was good overall. One disappointment.  We ordered the ceviche.  They brought it out with no chips or bread.  When we asked for some the waitress said she could bring out potato chips to dip in our scallop ceviche? No thanks, how about pita bread .  She stated she would "" put in an order"". So, after spending a lot of money on food and drinks we were charged an additional 2.50 for pita bread to eat our ceviche with which should have been included anyway."
"Southampton, PA",1/16/2014,2.0,Beer was good. Service was bad.The kitchen and oven space is to small to accommodate a full restaurant.There's a young team managing this place and it's palpable. I think it has potential with a management worth it's salt. It's a shame because it's a really nice space.
"Yardley, PA",8/15/2016,4.0,"This update is because I didn't give enough credit to the quality of the food here. The Duck Apple Pizza, Buffalo Brown Sugar pizza, and the duck confit fries, hummus trio, it's all AMAZING!"
"Levittown, PA",10/18/2014,4.0,"So my boyfriend and I went on a date here last night! We walked in, the hostess asked for our number and sent a text when our table was ready, we were told 20 mins but it's was not even 5 mins and we were sat! We had the kolsh, IPA and saison; the IPA being my favorite! We had the buffalo cauliflower (my favorite dish), the buffalo pizza and the humus platter all excellent choice which came out quicker then expected with great presentation! MY FAVORITE PART WAS DESSERT HOLY PEANUT BUTTER SMORES!! We had an awesome wait staff all polite and knowledgable! Will go here again!"
"Newtown, PA",1/24/2015,3.0,"Wait was insane... Even with the call ahead we had an hour plus wait. Food was awesome though.We got sausage pizza, brisket panini, crab cakes and a salad, as well as humus and bean soup for apps. No complaints other than the bread pudding was burnt and our server was unenthusiastic."
"Union City, NJ",8/13/2017,4.0,Awesome spot with really good IPAs. Didn't try the food but everything around us looked very tasty- will def try next time!
"Philadelphia, PA",3/2/2014,4.0,"After traveling around Bucks County all day yesterday, I was super hungry and ready to relax.  Vault is right in the center of Yardley and is definitely hopping on the weekends.  We went in to a packed restaurant but were promptly greeted by the hostess.  She entered my information electronically and we sat at the bar while waiting for a table.  It was super convenient since they text/call your cell phone when your table is ready.  The ambience was great, I really enjoyed the industrial brewery setup they had going on.  There was a live band playing some good jazz as well.  They had several house-brewed drafts available and through the course of the evening I tried two of them, the Belgian Blonde and the Vault IPA.  The Blonde was pretty good, a bit subtle, but smooth and crisp.  The Vault IPA was delicious, just the right amount of hops for me.  Their pizzas are delicious as well.  I tried the duck and sage pizza as well as the wild mushroom.  They had great flavor combinations and were nicely sized for a group to share."
"Newtown, PA",2/14/2016,5.0,"The Vault was amazing. The food was delicious! We got the buffalo cauliflower, pork belly fries, brown sugar pizza and everything was absolutely delish!!!!! I'm not a beer drinker but decided to taste their beer since that's what they're known for and WOW I was so surprised at how tasty it was. Not your average beer for sure. The only down fall was the wait. We came here on a Saturday night and waited about an hour for a table. I will definitely be back though."
"Princeton, NJ",4/6/2014,4.0,"Okay, I'm obsessed with this place. I love real estate and I love beer. I geek out hard at this place - the concept of repurposing an old space (a bank) and turning it into something new and awesome (a brewery) is a refreshing notion in this day and age of tear down/rebuilt something hideous.The food here is great. The menu changes frequently based off what's in season. The beer is also very good. I'm hoping they get some ""bigger"" brews (higher ABV) on tap in the future.For the food, definitely start with the hummus trio. The pita here is AMAZING. it's kind of raw in the middle and crispy on the outside. The butternut squash hummus might contain trace amounts of something illegal/addiction inducing.The flatbread pizzas are fabulous. I'm a big fan of the duck confit but they're all really great. Definitely wonder around the space - you can see the old vault that they now use as a fridge for the kegs and you can see the old drive thru as you come in from the parking lot out back."
"Newtown, PA",3/6/2017,3.0,"The food is really good but unfortunately the hostesses are rude and if you are really unfortunate to  get a female waitress it gets even worse   They are extremely rude.... literally was handed, not placed on the table but handed my huge pizza tray while my hands were full drinking!!!  Really ????and then given a rude look when I asked her to place it on the table  They are stuck up girls who crate a very unwelcoming atmosphere... like you should feel privileged to be eating there"
"Trenton, NJ",3/16/2015,4.0,"Since our first visit ,one thing is always the same.  Quality. And for that reason a little alone we will be  loyal customers.  On the menu it states No substitutions,just trust us, and by us trusting, we have never been disappointed food or beverage wise. For me a wait time for a table or a little bit of a wait when crowded,wouldn't  change my rating. While a few beers are not my taste, I do enjoy many and enjoy getting a growler filled for my weekend home"
"Hightstown, NJ",8/7/2018,1.0,"We decided to try this restaurant based on the great Yelp reviews.  Did everyone review the same restaurant we went to?  Although there were seats in the dining room and on the patio, they sat us in an area shared by the kitchen.  With pizza ovens.  In August.  During a heatwave.  It was 90 degrees outside at  8:30 pm and the same inside only no air circulating inside.  The server was downright unfriendly.  We ordered the pork belly fries appetizer.  They were quartered fingerling potatoes that were not cooked.  No seasoning to speak of.  Then I had the brisket sandwich.  The brisket was cooked well but again, no seasoning to be had.  My daughter had the burger with no bun.  They gave her a meat patty on a piece of lettuce.  No seasoning.  We both got house made sweet potato chips.  They were charred.  When we left and walked from where we were seated through the dining room to leave it was at least 15 degrees cooler.  Al in all, not a good experience at all."
"Philadelphia, PA",9/7/2016,5.0,I wish so badly they would have coke... Even atleast cans of it. That is my only complaint otherwise I love their food. Great experience going there each time with friends
"Wayne, PA",9/2/2016,5.0,"Super craft beer with perfect beer pairings of pizza, spicy appetizers and beautifully crafted salads. Very interesting old bank building with many of the original artifacts intact. Outdoor and indoor seating in a charming environment. The servings are hearty, super fresh and tastefully presented by warm friendly wait staff. For me, good beer, tasty fresh ""beer food"" in a very coolenvironment says ""come back soon and often. "" I plan to."
"Montreal, Canada",2/11/2014,3.0,Beer sampler was a great optionFinding parking wasn't so great.The pizza was great.Finding parking wasn't so great.The second beer sampler another great option.Did I mention parking!?
"Viera, FL",6/3/2013,3.0,"i was here a few months ago and am dying to go back... hoping they work out some of the kinks as they're relatively new... this place can be great!when we went, the beer selection was very limited but not bad. not great, but definitely not bad. cute atmosphere, though it gets a bit crowded in the bar area. street parking is hit-or-miss.the food was yummy, and i'm hoping to try more of the menu. we had the stuffed mushroom app which was jsut okay- the mushrooms were a bit wet, and could have used a little more seasoning. the pizza was yummy, though we stuck to a basic peperoni pie. they were playing around with some new combinations at that time, so i can't wait to see what made it to the menu. i loved the bamboo flatware and no-nonsense feel of the place. the s'mores were a fun treat!good enough to go back for sure. definitely a good addition to the area, with a ton of potential!"
"Langhorne, PA",8/20/2015,5.0,"Awesome food, awesome service, awesome beer. What more can you want? Buffalo cauliflower is perfect. Pizza is made in front of you in their brick oven, waitstaff always is pleasant and attentive. I've been here twice and definitely would recommend this place to everyone I know."
"Princeton, NJ",11/15/2015,3.0,"I really enjoyed the beer and the atmosphere, but the food didn't impress. I don't mind paying for something amazing, but $13 for a mediocre vegetarian Banh Mi (meaning tofu w/ a few pickled veggies & sriracha mayo) that comes with nothing on the side, methinks not. As for the atmosphere, it's energetic (read: loud, but not obnoxious), dimly lit in the evening with an open kitchen and a 310-gallon brewery."
"Collingswood, NJ",3/5/2014,3.0,"Nice location and nice idea, food was OK. Tried 2 different types of beers. Props for converting an old space and making it look nice, but the beer was just OK. The teller space where the pizzas were made is neat. Also nice that you can see the brewing area right behind the bar. Interesting mix of people (literally a group 8 kids with their parents next to a couple on a date). Would try again if I was in the area, but wouldn't go way out of my way to go here."
"Burlington, NJ",10/15/2016,4.0,"Ate lunch here yesterday  (October 14, 2016)...decent beer selection...I had the Sweet Potatoe Ale, all I can say is wow!...This is probably one of the best beers I ever had!...oh, and the food here is great too...menu is rather limited but is unique...I had the Cuban sandwich (panini)...for an appetizer I enjoyed the Buffalo cauliflower which was excellent!!...I'll be back!"
"Southampton, PA",12/29/2015,3.0,"The food is nice. The beer is great, especially if you can get the sweet potato ale. The servers seem more interested in talking with their friends than doing their jobs. Twice I've been here and twice I've been ignored while my servers were chatting for minutes on end. The live music is nice, but entirely too loud in the open setup of the restaurant."
"Levittown, PA",10/2/2017,5.0,"I have been many times, and I have never been disappointed. Their beers are constantly rotating, so every visit there is something new to try. I highly recommend getting the flight so you can try a little of everything. Their menu is small, but everything is delicious. The pizzas are outstanding (Seriously, get the buffalo brown sugar! It's fantastic!), the entrees are very good, and though I'm not usually a fan of the vegetable, the buffalo cauliflower is honestly amazing. I've only had to actually wait for a table once; they are usually able to seat right away. Even when the place is packed, the service doesn't suffer a bit--the waitresses are attentive and friendly, and the food/drinks arrive very quickly."
"Newtown, PA",5/9/2014,3.0,"A short 15 min wait. Great beers to pass the time: the IPA and the ESM. Food was great, very interesting the duck confit salad, crab cake sliders, and 2 flatbreads. A minor screwup on one flatbread, so it came out after the really late first one. A coins the hand pie dessert. The live music was entertaining.  Over 2 hrs for dinner a bit excessive."
"Columbus, NJ",9/28/2017,5.0,Delicious food and wine.  Fun place to go with a small group of friends.
"Langhorne, PA",5/25/2016,5.0,First off I would like to say the Men's Room In Langhorne is NOT CLOSED.I have been going to Shane for 13 years. He is the best Barber around. I have never left his Shop unhappy and I bring my Son as well.He is a great guy and doesn't mind talking. He remembers all the details I tell him about my family and is always talking about his family.
"Bensalem, PA",2/26/2016,4.0,"Went for my birthday dinner last night. My family and I shared the hummus board and antipasto board, as well as the maple brisket pizza. Everything was fantastic, we've never had a bad meal there."
"Willow Grove, PA",5/5/2016,5.0,"Great location in historic, old bank building.  GREAT FOOD every time. Salads, pizza, desserts.  EV. ER.  Y. TIME. Dont drink halcahol, but hear the ""beirsss"" are ""verrr niiiiice."" Wait staff is typically friendly, but more so focused on providing fast service. Owners are doing it right and it is no wonder why this is the best restaurant in Yardley. Weekends are hectic during the evening, and although the live jazz is great, it gets WAYYY too loud in the main dining room for these sensitive ears. Consider patio seating in the summer. RETURNING, weekly."
"West Chester, PA",2/14/2016,4.0,"I checked out vault a year or two ago, but the beer was good, and the ambiance was nice. Can't remember if I got food, but it's great to have more local breweries!"
"Yardley, PA",2/11/2013,3.0,"This is a hard one to review because it has potential to be a 4 or 5 star with a few changes.  They just opened, so there is time to work out the kinks.   The ambiance is 5 stars all the way; beautiful, has to be seen.  The ingredients in the food were also top notch....but the execution was sloppy.  The food was very high quality but put together lacking attention to detail.  The staff in the kitchen was loud and unprofessional, goofing off and texting with tickets in the window.  The waitresses seemed a little disinterested.The beer was pretty OK.  I liked the oatmeal stout quite a bit and thought the sweet potato ale was well above average.Ambiance *****Food***1/2Beer***1/2Service**"
"Levittown, PA",8/27/2016,4.0,Amazing food beer and ambiance. Servers can sometimes have an attitude but over all its grear
"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",2/10/2013,5.0,"Great brew pub on Main st. in Yardley. 1st visit, went during ""Storm of the Century""  Nemo. Live Jazz was a bonus, but the real stars were the beers. Just missed the pin of Simancoe (?)  Rye IPA, but tried a flight of the rest. Loved the ESB and Belgian Blonde. Very nice flat bread pizzas as well, we tried the Margherita and the Fig/Prosciutto, both were crunchy crust and fresh toppings. Rich (the server) took great care of us all night, was definitely a nice way to spend the snow storm.Great old stone bank building, with a roaring brick fire oven and nice bar area."
"Trenton, NJ",6/30/2017,4.0,Beautiful decor and delicious food. The brunch pizza was so much better than I expected.
"Bensalem, PA",1/17/2016,4.0,"Um their pork belly fries is all you need in life! The buffalo cauliflower, pizza, and smores were really good as well.  The beers are solid...especially the new world ipa.  Its a really cool looking spot too."
"Yardley, PA",9/17/2015,5.0,"Awesome spot right in the heart of Yardley. Not really a ""fun for the kiddos"" place, as it's more of a bar scene, so anytime my husband and I have a free night on a weekend to ourselves we automatically come here. Fun atmosphere with live music, awesome beer selection, or wine if you prefer. If they have the sweet potato ale on tap - GET IT! So good! The food is off the hook too. I love the cheese platter and my hubby usually gets the flatbread or pizza. The salads are awesome too. They used to have this incredibly delicious duck salad, which I didn't see on the menu last time we went, so it's possible that they change it up. Another thing I noticed is the wide range of patrons, all ages, all styles, everyone fits in. Couldn't possibly say enough good things about Vault Brewing!"
"Fairless Hills, PA",12/25/2012,2.0,"My ate there in early November, and I have been meaning to leave some feedback for some time now.  We really wanted to like this place, but alas there were many repeated let downs.  Beer - I enjoy micro beer and craft beer, especially from our NE area of the country.  There are many good choices, even locally such as Neshaminy Creek brewing.  Sadly the beer here was extremely underwhelming with very little flavor or body.  A good effort for someone just starting to brew, but not for a brew pub.Food - We got the humus platter and while the hummus was very good, they provided about half of the pita bread necessary to consume all of the hummus.  Our workaround?  We used the crust from our pizza.  Pizza was above average, but being very small, one could never eat here for dinner.  Simply a snack.  Buffalo was our favorite.Atmosphere - Lighting was not adequate and made the place feel a little cold.    Music was good, but since there is a lack of sound absorbing material, the place echos greatly.  This amplifies all conversations to the point it's hard to relax or talk.  We were even around the corner away from the band/speakers.Seating - I am not sure who picked out the seating, but the knee high tables are awful.  Then when getting our 2 pizzas delivered, the hostess was unable to put both on our table.   Again another workaround was required.  Besides that the tables take up a more floor space than necessary, so taller tables would be better all around.We really hope they improve as it would be great to have a good local brew pup we can go to.  We'll try again soon."
"Royersford, PA",4/22/2015,2.0,"I've been here a couple times in the past with an okay experience. I decided that I wanted to share the place with my wife, and decided to drive 40 minutes to get there, only to find out that they don't have any highchairs for my daughter to sit in. There are plenty of parents that enjoy the taste of craft beer, and I think it's ignorant for this brewpub to fail at accommodating young parents. Take a tip from one of the best brewery in the area (Victory). They have all sorts of activities for kids to play with. I didn't get to share my experience with my wife, and we had to go to some crappy pizza joint down the street because of it. You blew it."
"Morrisville, PA",8/18/2015,5.0,"Consistently great.  One of my favorite go-to spots in the area.  Beers are wonderful and food is delicious (buffalo brown sugar pizza or gtfo).  Growlers are a bit pricey, and I'm disappointed that they've done away with call-ahead seating but I never have to wait too too long.  A favorite for sure."
"Bergenfield, NJ",5/13/2017,5.0,Stopped in to try some local beverages and stayed to enjoy the chicken & greens salad.  All of the beers we're delicious however I was partial to the Fine Fette Blonde. The salad was probably the best salad I have ever eaten. I highly recommend you try this place if you are in the area!
"Ewing Township, NJ",8/13/2016,5.0,"Fantastic! Nice people, open kitchen. Terrific beer. Sometimes there is a long wait to get in, but worth it!"
"Trenton, NJ",6/18/2015,3.0,"Vault has certainly come a long way from when they first opened, but there are still some rough edges.The beer is vastly improved.  I generally have the Blonde, but tried the Belgian Wit.  It was fine, nothing super special.  My boyfriend had the IPA and was happy with it.We ordered the Pork Belly Fries as a starter; good concept, a little lacking in execution.  The ends of the ""fries""we charred black on one section.  I believe this to be an anomaly, because the pics I've seen on Yelp don't show this to be an on-going problem.  The aiolis that accompanied the fries were tasty.Pizzas for both of us: one buffalo brown sugar, one wild mushroom.  I would have shifted the sweet-spicy balance on the buffalo more towards the spicy end.  There were definitely big blobs of crunchy brown sugar that made the pizza verge on too sweet.  This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, it was tasty for sure.  The mushroom pizza came with a nice big pile of arugula, which pair nicely with the earthiness of the mushrooms.Service was not good.  Our server seems a bit spaced-out and wasn't all that attentive.  I've never gotten amazing service here, but servers can turn over pretty regularly, so there always a chance that could change.Space is VERY loud and perhaps slightly under-lit, but it's a warm room and not without its charms."
"Morrisville, PA",1/29/2014,5.0,"Huge fan of The Vault!  I think we are lucky to have something like this in Yardley and have really enjoyed going there. The staff is excellent: friendly, knowledgable and passionate about great beer. The rotation of the brews that they concoct make it fun to constantly go back for more. The food is great and has evolved since their opening to include more options, all quite tasty. The live jazz component is amazing - wild to enjoy live tunes and great beer and not have to travel to New Hope, Philly or elsewhere to do so.  The ambiance makes it tough to remember when I opened a checking account there and actually makes it feel like you're in a swanky club in Manhattan, Morocco or who knows where!Great tip: get a growler (they sell them ""at cost"" and get 64 oz to go...you get a nice discount, bring home great beer and of course support a local business."
"Yardley, PA",12/28/2015,5.0,Really good food and pretty good beer. The service is usually good and there is jazz on the weekends. What's not to love. I highly recommend the buffalo cauliflower it's amazing.
"Langhorne, PA",12/22/2015,5.0,"Love, love LOVE this place.Great beer, good food.  And the beer battered s'mores are a dream come true!"
"Philadelphia, PA",12/16/2012,3.0,"I like the friendly polish of this place as well as the live music that is entertaining without being overwhelming if you want to have a conversation. While the beer is good, the food selection and non-alcoholic beverage options are quite limited.  When there were no salads on menu, I tried the New Tomato and Truffle Humus special, which was not very flavorful. The sweet and spicy Brown Sugar Buffalo pizza was tasty, but not large. I would like to come back, so I hope that the menu continues to expand and evolve."
"Hendersonville, NC",8/7/2015,5.0,"Get the buffalo cauliflower! The pickled celery it comes with is like candy, I can't stop!"
"Philadelphia, PA",6/14/2015,5.0,"I'm a true city gal so I always love exploring gastopubs in suburban towns. The Vault in Yardley is not to be missed. Farm to table ingredients, brewed beer on-site and organic wine! I definitely recommend going for a late lunch, we got sat right away outside. Enjoy a beer flight, the prosciutto and fig salad, and finally the mushroom pizza. I would definitely go back if I was in town!"
"Newtown, PA",8/28/2013,1.0,"Lived in Yardley all my life and REALLY wanted to like The Vault, but can't. The three times I've gone, the service was just below average. Each time I've been I felt like it was a chore to get a drink. No servers came to me for 15 minutes so I had to just walk up to the bar myself.Haven't had the food so can't comment on that. Would be surprised if it's open next year. In the middle of the week Continental Tavern is packed each night while crickets can be heard at the vault."
"Allston, Boston, MA",8/26/2017,5.0,"This place is a true gem in downtown Yardley! Amazing/consistently tasty food, attentive and friendly service, and unique beers. Loved the live music and social atmosphere"
"Bensalem Township, PA",12/15/2016,5.0,"This place is such a gem for the area. I love the selection of beers they have on tap. They range from IPA's to stouts and everything in between. And their food menu....yummmm! For dinner with friends we all shared the pork belly fries. They were amazing!! Nice giant pieces of project belly and the cheese on the fries, it really was fresh mozzarella. For dinner I had the chicken sandwich...I know it sounds plain and boring but the flavors, from the bread to the cheese, we're a perfect combination. My husband had the chili pizza....he finished the whole pie by himself. My girlfriend had the broccoli bacon pizza and she had all but two slices. Their pizza was made in a brick oven so it came out perfectly crisp and thin, but that's how we like our pizza. Her boyfriend had the crab cakes sandwich which he said was amazing. I wish we had room for dessert because the dessert menu looked amazing. Oh, and for anyone that doesn't really like beer...come for the food, plus they have a great selection of wine and excellent sangria."
"Totowa, NJ",7/20/2016,5.0,A lovely gem of a restaurant.  I love their salads and hummus trio.  Excellent selection of beer and great atmosphere.
"Ewing Township, NJ",4/15/2016,5.0,"Went here tonight. This place was amazing, great pizza(brown sugar buffalo and margarita), awesome beer, and a cool vibe. Definitely coming back. The pork belly fries are dope!"
"Metuchen, NJ",4/15/2016,5.0,"Great beer. Great food. Ordered the beer sampler, sausage pizza, and house salad. Great prices. Worth the visit!!"
"New Hope, PA",1/12/2013,5.0,"LOVE this micro-brewery. Walking in, there are safety deposit boxes in the doorway, giving away that this location used to be a bank. Inside, it is tastefully decorated with hip music playing and the smell of hops in the air. The stools at the round cocktail tables are very unique and fun. In between sipping delicious beers and eating hummus, we took a tour which was very interesting. I definitely recommend it while you're there. I will definitely be returning - so glad to see such a cool place in Yardley!"
"Trenton, NJ",7/14/2016,3.0,"The beers have always been lacking since they've opened - the flavors were never middling for the type and always fell on the light side.  Finally they got a good one with their Waimea IPA - what you'd expect for a citrusy, hoppy IPA.  Expensive, just like everything there (you're in Yardley after all) but at least it tastes good.That said, their real draw is the food.  From all the different flatbreads/pizzas to their hummus, chili, and fries, you can't go wrong with dinner here."
"Philadelphia, PA",10/25/2012,2.0,"I had hoped this place could replace Triumph as the weekly hangout spot for my friend and I. It failed.It could've been great because yardley is only a few minutes away and a recent menu change dropped our opinion of Triumph way down. But after one drink a piece we walked out and drove to New Hope. I'm hardly a drinker, mostly just cider, but even my friend thought their Belgian Blond had a really unpleasant after taste and we both agreed their sweet potato beer was Flavorless.  With no bar stools and a somewhat awkward layout ... the place is just a flop.  I liked the building... but that was basically it."
"Chambersburg, PA",1/9/2014,5.0,Awesome Beer and equally Awesome food. I would HIGHLY recommend this establishment to anyone!!!
"Coatesville, PA",7/14/2014,5.0,"We came for the tour and stayed for lunch! Great service, beer, food and atmosphere! Highly recommended!"
"Lawrence Township, NJ",3/23/2016,4.0,"A friend and we're here for dinner tonite. This is one of my favorite local restaurants because the food is so good. Tonite,however there was apparently a problem in the kitchen and after an hour with no food, I asked to speak to the manager (our waiter seemed inexperienced and didn't quite know how to handle the situation) The manager, Chris, came over immediately, brought our food within 5 minutes, and told us the meal was on the house. He encouraged us to order dessert and when we declined, he gave us a gift certificate! I am really impressed with how he handled the situation. He saw there was a problem and he solved it!  I will certainly be coming back for their terrific chicken panini! Thanks Chris!!!"
"Blue Bell, PA",7/27/2015,5.0,Stopped in here for a quick brew and snack with my husband and we were both pleasantly surprised. The ambience is really cool since it's in an old bank. The beers are pretty solid. We had the hummus plate and the red and yellow pizza. The hummus plate was amazing. I would come back just for that and a beer. The red and yellow pizza was okay. The tomatoes were a little mealy and should have been wrung out before being put on the pizza because the pizza was really soggy. I can see where parking might be a bit of an issue at times however they have a sign out front directing patrons to the lot across the street which was super helpful since we're not from the area.  Bottom line is we'll definitely (and happily) be back!
"Philadelphia, PA",7/3/2016,5.0,Best local spots around. Great rotation of beers. Great local wines from Crossing Vineyards. Brown sugar buffalo pizza is AMAZING!!!
"Philadelphia, PA",6/24/2016,5.0,"Anything less than 5 starts is a mistake, I have been going here since about a week after it opened and have NEVER had anything that wasn't outstanding. hands down The Best beer I have ever had , period, and the food matches up too. There are no bad choices. When they first opened they had a very limited menu so they could focus on doing it well,and it has grown since but NEVER lost that level of quality. Their staff are beyond reproach, always courteous, attentive , friendly and professional, no phonies. I you have never been here I feel very sorry for you."
"Trenton, NJ",2/25/2018,2.0,"No no no. I need to leave a review because we accidentally went twice because the first time was over a year earlier and we didn't realize until after we were seated. We gave it another chance. The food is terrible. First time I got an uninspired, mediocre, overpriced cheese plate and my significant other got a sandwich he said was very average. He isn't picky so that says a lot. The second time I had this waffle grilled cheese with garlic. This wasn't good at all. The waitress actually recommended it. Do the servers/chefs here have taste buds? I need to leave this review so I remember not to return. The pizza wasn't even good and that's what they are known for. It's a shame because I like the way the inside looks-dim lighting, wooden dungeon complete with dragon and princess look. It's a neat place but the food just doesn't measure up to what you would expect. The homemade soda is also overpriced and barely sweet. I will remember not to make a third mistake of returning."
"Riverton, NJ",2/14/2016,4.0,"I went here on a Saturday night for drinks. It was PACKED, which was expected, but we still got decent service at the bar. The atmosphere was really cool- live musicians were playing some interesting music involving violins, and there was old-fashioned decor that gave the place a cool vibe. The beer was decent, nothing above average in my opinion but I have high expectations. I tried the pale ale and an IPA, as well as an apple brandy barrel aged Belgian beer. I didn't try the food, but it smelled incredible and the food looked really good. I would love to go back and try it next time."
"Doylestown, PA",4/1/2013,3.0,"I'm a regular and really like this place. Was there this past Saturday and something really perturbed me.Packed house and a half hour wait for a 4 top, smack dab in the middle of the floor is a high top that's cleaned off and ready to be used. Asked the hostess if these were first come first serve and said no. A bit puzzled, I kept an eye on that table and a good 20min goes by with nobody sitting at it. Finally, a group of 5 come prancing through the door and sit at this reserved table. Just think its sort of ridiculous that there were a ton of people waiting for a table and management didn't give the table up.Second issue, an hour and twenty minutes go by and the hostess approaches asking if we still want the table. Granted we already had inhaled the irresistible brown sugar buffalo pizza so we declined. The Vault is also pricey for what you get but that may be the owners trying to play the Yardley crowd. No need to chastise me here, spend a minimum of $50 a week at the Vault, just think the portions could be a bit bigger given the cost. Also noticed the prosciutto on the buffalo pizza get more and more sparse with each month that passes.All in all a great place but be prepared to stand if you go on a weekend, week nights are usually fine."
"New Hope, PA",10/11/2012,4.0,"Dusted off my Yelp account today just to review this place.The long awaited Vault brewery is now open! I was there last night for the soft opening and had a really great time. The staff was very friendly and attentive, the beers were great and so was the food. I had the Brown Sugar Buffalo pizza and it was amazeballs. I was also a huge fan of the hefewizen, and I can't wait to try the sweet potato ale when its ready.I'll most definitely be coming back."
"Washington Crossing, PA",5/27/2016,4.0,Excellent selection of beers. Staff is very friendly. Menu is a bit light but the pizza is very good. A good place to meet friends after work.
"Wayne, PA",6/14/2017,5.0,Great al fresco dining! Yummy gluten free options - fig & prosciutto salad & buffalo chicken salad and peach sangria
"Philadelphia, PA",10/11/2012,4.0,"I went to Vault brewery last night for their ""soft opening."" Some places do this the night before the grand opening to make sure everything's working properly ( the registers, taps,etc...) We got word of the secret opening and had to check it out.The place is beautiful inside. Very upscale look. Everyone was extremely friendly.A women named Christina was our server. She was awesome!!!! VERY nice and super fast with our orders. Her food recommendations were right on. The Brown Sugar Buffalo pizza was delicious.Now for the beer. Very good. Definitely better then Triumph brewery. The Bavarian Hefeweizen was my favorite out of the bunch. The IPA is very solid too.The only reason I didn't give this place five stars was because it is a bit pricey, but then again it's to be expected being in Yardley, PA.  Plus, there will be no happy hour at this place. Knowing that I probably won't be going there a few times a week or anything, however I will be a regular customer.  :)Good job guys!"
"Trenton, NJ",7/13/2016,5.0,The Vault is amazing when you can actually get in.  Even on a Sunday at 2:00 there is a 45 min wait.... It's just that good but it sucks it's so packed.  The beer is second to none!! Love it when I can get it.
"Princeton, NJ",1/17/2015,3.0,"Another joint with the word ""Vault.""  Hmmm.. guess what the building was before it was turned into a brewery?  Yep, a bank.  Yes, there is another pizza joint in Bordertown, NJ called ""Vault.""  The decor is much better here.In any case, I went to this restaurant and had a pizza, Buffalo cauliflowers, and crab sliders.  Buffalo cauliflowers were good and so were the crab sliders, but they were nothing to brag about.  Now, the pizza.  I don't get these fancy artisan pizzas with itsy-bitsy ingredients and crust that takes up the half of a pie and cost $12 and up.  I guess I'm too lower-middle-class to enjoy this type of dish.  I had a Margarita pie and it tasted OK.  But for the reason above and price of it, I just couldn't enjoy it.  Maybe some hoity-toity wealthy folks from Yardley may like it.The menu is minimal.  I must say, I have never been to a brewery where they don't serve hamburgers.  I didn't drink beer, so I can't really comment on that.  Good place to take your love interest.  Not really good for families with small kids.  I probably won't repeat."
"Austin, TX",10/20/2012,5.0,"Fantastic!  Three of my colleagues and I met for drinks after work, but ended up staying for the beer flights and pizza for the entire night.  The beer was great; I prefer the darker varieties and they were sold out of the coffee stout and the dry stout so I tried the ESB.  The ESB would be my recommendation for those of us who have a bolder palette.  The taste is kinda toasty, not too heavy, and great for the fall.The food was surprising! I did not expect much when I walked in because this place was obviously founded for the beer.  We ordered the three hummus board,  the salami and brie board, the brown sugar buffalo pizza, and the white mint pizza.   I would recommend ordering all 4 of these.  The hummus will surprise you too. Their recipe for dough is PERFECT. The dough is used for the pizza and the hummus. Also, I commend the owners for the attention to detail.  I liked the cooper pizza oven, the interesting choices for seating (tractor seats!), the bathroom was very clean, the glassware choices were modern and easy to hold, the wait staff was very nice (especially Amber the hostess), and the food and beer flights are served on these beautiful walnut trays.PROS: ESB Beer, knowledgeable owners, white mint pizza, unique ambiance, and the hot bartenders.CONS: A bit crowded since this is still ""the new place in town"" and my beer preferences were sold out.I will be back soon to try the coffee stout and sweet potato ale!"
"Newtown, PA",9/13/2015,3.0,"Still three stars, the pad Thai popcorn is now off the menu. Great pizza and beer, the wine is still the overpriced crossing vineyards stuff. This does mean you really have to be in the mood for beer and pizza, if not then there are plenty of other options nearby."
"Charlotte, NC",9/12/2013,4.0,Was in town on business and found this place for lunch. Great food for lunch! Quality ingredients an prompt service. The burger was excellent (great quality beef)!If definitely come back!
"Coopersburg, PA",6/5/2013,4.0,"I really enjoyed my afternoon visit to Vault.  It was a Sunday afternoon and we were just at the relatively nearby Crossing Vineyards for a wine tasting when they mentioned the wine served at Vault, a newer microbrewery in the area, was from that vineyard.  Because we were just there for fun and are much more into beer, we stopped asking about the wine and started asking more about Vault.  Our host gave us directions, a warning to follow the speed limit in Yardley borough, and we were off!Vault is a very cool looking place made cooler by the fact that they left the vault of the bank building they now occupy in operation, except now it holds riches of beer.  We had a sampler and enjoyed all of the beers but I preferred the Extra Pale Ale and my husband enjoyed the  Chinook IPA.  We also ended up ordering a very delicious flatbread that was made in what I believe was a wood burning oven.  The pizza was crispy and tasty and the varied, abundant toppings on the Prosciutto Fig pizza really hit the spot.We didn't stay for too long, but we definitely plan to make the trek back in the near future, especially if we can time our visit for one of the weekend nights when they feature live jazz.  Plus, my husband is dying to get one of their very fancy stainless steel growlers.  They are definitely something out of the ordinary in and of themselves and if they're an excuse to visit Vault again, I'm in!"
"Toms River, NJ",3/29/2017,5.0,Amazing food and great beer. Love the atmosphere and the staff is very nice !!!!! Definitely would recommend to friends and family.
"San Francisco, CA",10/20/2012,3.0,"Came here on a Friday Night for beer & food. Very Crowded.First Impressions: Building & Decor = AwesomeBeer = OK. Nothing special, good flavors, but most lacked body.Bar Staff = Friendly, though bartenders seemed inexperienced.Wait Staff = Friendly,  though overworked & rushed. They did not seem knowledgeable about the beers, (or even talked about them.) Never gave us napkins. We were also given the wrong pizza, (it was for the next table) but they quickly solved it, because we told them.Seating= Cozy, but cramped & very small. Spent the majority of the nite bumping into people or being touched from passers-by or even the next tables! Even saw the table next to us with 3 people & 2 chairs?!? 2 girls were sitting in one seat.Food= Gotta say, everything I ate was great. The menu is a small focused size, with mostly light pizza (or disassembled pizza, aka tapas) fare. That being said, if you were really hungry I would NOT eat here. The food serves more as a complement to the beers than a main course of eating. Also, FOOD ORDER TOOK FOREVER (I don't think they were designed to be as crowded as they were that night, seemed overwhelmed)Prices: They felt high but had the place been less crowded, and the cozy tables spread out more, I think they would've been more justified. I would like to see more attentive wait staff on my next visit as well for the prices charged."
"PA, PA",5/23/2017,5.0,The is the best local brewery hands down! The Belgium blonde is one of the best I've ever had goes down so smooth. Pairs great with their amazing burgers or the Buffalo brown sugar pizza. Small yet intimate location with amazing stuff.
"Trenton, NJ",10/21/2012,3.0,"Being a big beer guy I'm always excited to visit new breweries.  This place is about a 30 minute drive for me in Downtown Yardley PA.  From a distance, it looks like any other building in the area, but upon entering you realize it's much different.  The decor is very nice, high ceilings, immediate yeasty, malty smell - great first impression.  The serving tanks are visible from the main seating area behind the bar.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly.   The menu is small as they mostly specialize in pizza and other finger food.  I was surprised to see the prices of some of the items on the menu.  Beers are $6 a glass and $8 for a flight including only 4 samples.  We decided to go with Pizza (all personal sized and starting at $12) and Beer Flights.The pizza was just ok, but at $14 for a personal sized pizza I would have expected the best.  When the samplers came out, the person that brought them out had no idea which one was which.  At most breweries, the samples are labeled in some way which helps identify who ordered what, but this place does not label their flights and it caused a lot of confusion.  I ended up with my friend's flight, and had to do a bunch of swapping to get it right.  The beer was also just ok.  Overall I think this place has a lot of potential.  I have to give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened up and are probably getting into the swing of things.  They need to make major improvements on their pizza and also their beer, which unfortunately is the staple of their business.  They also need to work on their prices.  I'm not sure what type of customers they are trying to appeal to, but at these prices they might have a tough time appealing to a broader range of customers.  They might consider reducing prices, or consider making portion sizes bigger - and that goes for beer too."
"Philadelphia, PA",10/11/2012,5.0,"I enjoyed a pint of Bavarian Hefeweizen and a pint of Dry Stout, Both were excellent! Looking forward to trying more beers and of course the food! :-)"
"Philadelphia, PA",8/15/2015,5.0,"Great atmosphere, great beer, great staff,  great food.  Great place to grab a drink with loved ones or strangers!"
"Bucks, PA",5/29/2015,5.0,The buffalo cauliflower was awesome!  Great Beers and good service.  Live music was also good.  Try it!
"New York, NY",11/30/2014,5.0,"Great place!   They brew  their own beer and even offer them in tasting flights.  The sweet potato ale is very tasty.  Especially when it's paired with one of the delicious thin crusted pizzas.  My favorite is the Buffalo pizza with brown sugar and prosciutto.  And don't forget to try the Pad Thai popcorn for a start and finish the night off with a s'more!  It does get really crowded though, so go early to snag a seat.  Enjoy!"
"Doylestown, PA",4/29/2013,4.0,"Fun (and inexpensive) place for Friday night drinks (but get there early, it fills fast) - my honey loves unique beers so he enjoyed sampling a few different types (sounds like one was really sweet). They only serve locally produced wines (which are way too sweet) but fun to support locals. We met another couple at sat at the high tops in the back, we could see the fun wood fired oven where they were busy creating all kinds of pizza.We ordered a few plates to share. The antipasta (large) was absolutely delish with artichokes, salamis, arugula, fresh mozzella and I think maybe even local cheeses. The buffalo cauliflower was interesting (not sure I would order it again). I had a taste of the fig pizza (not GF friendly) but it had dried figs on it (I wouldn't have expected that) and it was average, love the idea of thin crust pizza for my honey. We saw the crab cakes which looked great and their salads sounded fabulous - we will try those next time.Live Jazz is a great addition (it is loud) but creates a great atmosphere. Parking is a bit of a treasure hunt in Yardley but well worth it. If you want a fun place to support local, it is a great little spot and we will be back."
"Charlottesville, VA",3/4/2017,3.0,"The food was pretty good. The hostess had her cell out, literally plugged into the host stand and was texting the whole time. The waitresses all had a uniform on that consisted of skin tight leggings with a waist length sweatshirt. Come on guys I don't want to be a party pooper but just put some real clothes on and put the phones down. I get that this is a brewery but if you want me to spend $15 on a sandwich and I'm not at ""the tilted kilt"" or ""hooters"" put some clothes on and pay attention to your clientele. Again, the food was pretty good."
"Morrisville, PA",10/31/2015,4.0,We like the beer sampler.  The pizza is good.  Buffalo cauliflower is excellent. We enjoyed our time.
"Manhattan, NY",5/27/2015,4.0,Beer and food are great but it was really annoying to swat away fruit flies during our entire experience.
"Burlington, NJ",1/20/2018,1.0,"Drinks are a bit overpriced, but the food is great so it makes the visit worth it. I'm giving one star today for a big lapse in service: we tried to bring a group of friends to show off our local pub/brewery, but we couldn't get a table together. We called the day before to make arrangements, but they do not take reservations. Our group planned to come in early for dinner, 5pm on the dot, and the staff gave us confident assurances that they could accommodate a small group at that early time.  They even said they would ""make a note"" and do what they could to help us. So nice, right?  We showed up at 4:58pm and the place was packed. Even the giant back room was packed. BUT it was not so packed that they couldn't seat our group had they ""made a note"" like they said--there were several tables open scattered around the restaurant just not together. They said we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table together.  I know that kind of wait is not unreasonable had we just walked in, but we had pre-coordinated and believed we were receiving special treatment. It was embarrassing and frustrating for us. Don't lure us to your restaurant with false promises--be honest and tell us you cannot predict the patronage surges and we would have gone with a safer arrangement.  It went a little downhill from there, we took a small table while we tried to brainstorm a solution, but it was clear that the hostesses had washed their hands of us.  We left.  This is not the restaurant/brewery that you want for groups, events, or special occasions (unless you're only seating 2-4)."
"Lawrence Township, NJ",4/14/2013,4.0,"This place is a great addition to Yardley, PA right on Main St - had no issues with parking across the street. Dropped by this place on a Saturday night with a friend for a few beers and stories...great brew house! Enjoyed pale ales and a double ipa along with their version of potato wedges and a hummus platter. Great beer, great food - all at a friendly price (6 beers, 2 apps for $43). It was a bit crowded when we arrived around 9pm, the bar area is relatively small but on the flip side this made the bartenders very attentive! There are ledges that extend around the walls and make great nooks to put a beer down and talk. The live band was jammin something jazzy - a bit loud in my opinion making conversation a bit difficult. After 1030pm the crowd pretty much cleared out, there was space at the bar and in the open area with bar tables available - I'd say coming here around that time for just beer would be a good idea especially since they are open till1am.Last words: Beer is good here, I will be coming back."
"New York, NY",10/23/2015,5.0,"Food is excellent as well as the craft beers, the staff is very friendly and helpful.   Always new beers to try.   Best place in Yardley and surrounding area."
"Yardley, PA",10/14/2015,5.0,Great flat bread pizzas salads etc. I like beer but I don't love it. I wish their wine selection was better but I get that it's a brewery.
"Doylestown, PA",9/19/2015,4.0,"Great mushroom and arugula pizza for me, chicken sandwich for my husband which he said was delicious.  We eat out a lot and appreciate when food is really good-this food was !  Excellent service, great atmosphere, good beer and cider. Will definitely return."
"Gowanus, Brooklyn, NY",1/4/2016,5.0,"Best Hop Drop Ever! Delicious food, music, service and a perfect start to our New Year!"
"Princeton, NJ",9/6/2013,4.0,"My boyfriend and I tried this place out last night and were very happy with everything from the beers to the food. The antipasto was fabulous, and the duck confit peach flat bread was AMAZING! The live Jazz elevated the entire evening to a higher level.Will definitely try it again soon."
"Clark, NJ",4/27/2015,5.0,"Good food. Great staff. GREAT beer. This cool place gets a fifth star from me just for their Russian Imperial Stout aged in apple brandy barrels. Apparently they tapped the keg yesterday, so I got very lucky randomly stopping in for the first time today. Wow. What an awesome brew. Get some..."
"ANNANDALE, NJ",11/11/2014,5.0,Went there for Friday night drinks and pizza. I highly recommend their duck and bacon pizza and their sweet potato ale. Its also quite busy on a Friday night so I recommend calling a head for their 1hour seating it made the wait much better.
"Thousand Oaks, CA",8/3/2015,4.0,First time here. I used to live in town and have not been in yardley for 20 years. I used to go to the bank that the vault is in now. Great Main Street location. Nice patio on the side with heaters. I did not eat so I can't comment on food. The blonde ale was great and I enjoyed it. I would go back when I'm passing through.
"Washington, DC",1/17/2017,5.0,"Best restaurant in Yardley. Food is top of the line, beer is delicious and the atmosphere is very cool. I look for any reason to go to the Vault. Very , very yummy! Also, wait staff and bartenders are awesome :)"
"Columbia, MD",5/3/2015,5.0,"We visit the Vault every time we're in town.  The beer is amazing.  We always seem to find something we like.  It's so good, we bring home a growler each time.  The food is delicious.  Great place to go!"
"Morrisville, PA",10/30/2015,5.0,"Fun place, great brewskies and the best wild mushroom pizza!  Love it!  Good for Yardley!!!"
"Hillsborough, NJ",4/18/2015,4.0,Definitely will be back for more.  Great beer sampler and the food was very good and reasonably priced. I would recommend outside seating weather permitting.
"Yardley, PA",6/26/2015,5.0,"Love The Vault--Great atmosphere, food and beer!The Buffalo Brown Sugar pizza is amazing!"
"Blue Ridge, GA",1/1/2013,5.0,"Good stouts. Great IPA. Amazing pizza!Not much food selection, so it's not a place I'd go for big meal. But for snacking and drinking, it's good. Tried the potato skins. Nothing special, but my companion had the margarita and I the buffalo pizza. Both were fantastic. Not filling but the glazes were delectable. Tried two stouts. They were good.  The IPA though was quite tasty. Not too bitter but very floral and citrusy, which is how I like them. Atmosphere is very nice. It was super busy when we went, but we weren't in a hurry. Probably a bit more pleasant when less busy. The manager (I assume) was going around and chatting, apologizing for the wait. Really nice touch. Hope more like this come to his area. We need better options around here."
"Downtown, Seattle, WA",2/24/2015,4.0,"I came here to taste the beer.  Had the Amber which was good.  But the real reason you want to come here is for the brown sugar pizza.  Buffalo sauce (spicy), with prosciutto (salty), topped with brown sugar.  The taste profile was awesome.  The drawback is it is a little off the beaten path and parking is tough.  Had a beer and pizza for under $20.  Service was ok."
"West Berlin, NJ",12/26/2016,5.0,Worth the drive! Brews we're great and the food was amazing! Richie and Kelly Ann were awesome! Try the duck pizza and pork belly fries! Def coming back!
"Manhattan, NY",10/22/2017,5.0,"After spending a chaotic day at Sesame Place and coming out smelling of fried food and tears - a friend recommended we try Yardley for dinner, knowing we like a good brew pub at the end of a long day. Vault was perfect. Charming, warm and welcoming, even to our 3-year-old, we had the most civilized and delicious meal we've had in years. The Banh Mi burger was splendid and flavorful, with just enough spice. Our son's grilled cheese was buttery and delightful. The Cuban sandwich was rich and full of flavor. Even the house salad was notably delicious! Paired with a tasting flight of beer (we recommend the 5th anniversary), we were happy campers! And the dessert selection all looked incredible -we settled on the Black & White and were pleasantly surprised by the subtle hints of nutmeg in the vanilla custard. Our server Andrew, and the whole staff we encountered, were pleasant, friendly and helpful - true professionals. A memorable dinner for all of us!"
"Yardley, PA",6/4/2015,4.0,Vault is a local spot for me. I don't care about jazz music or fancy beers (wine or cocktail drinker here) but what I do love is pork belly fries and great thin crust pizzas and s'mores for dessert. Good place to bring visitors to.
"Morrisville, PA",1/22/2014,2.0,"I've been to Vault three times now, so I think a review is warranted. For this third visit, we had received a gift card and decided to head over early on a Tuesday night, since we had our 10-month old. The plan was to have dinner and a drink each.When we walked in, the hostesses looked at us like we had two heads. They asked, ""dinner for 3?"" We said yes, then asked for a high chair. They said ""We don't have high chairs. Also, our entire dining room is reserved for a private event tonight. You can sit at one of those high tops though. Do you think that baby can sit on one of those chairs?"" Ummmm.. no.So I quickly decided that we'd order take-out and have one drink while waiting. We both ordered an oatmeal stout. It was decent, though not worth the price. I fancy myself a craft brew snob, so I know a thing or two about beer. These stouts had to be 65 degrees. Not very pleasing. I understand colder beer inhibits taste but these were too warm. 45-55 degrees would have been better.On to the food.. we've had their food before, and know that it's tasty but expensive. So, we were ready for the prices. I ordered a buffalo/brown sugar pizza and my wife ordered the margherita pizza. We ordered some sort of goat cheese beet salad too.The food came out pretty quickly and we were on our way. My pizza had barely any meat on it. My wife's pizza was fine. We picked through the salad because the beets were disgusting and most of the salad was made up of some kind of bitter green.So for $about $52 we got two warm beers, two 10"" pizzas and a bad salad. I don't think we'll be back."
"Malvern, PA",1/22/2015,3.0,"Let me preface that this isn't my type of place, I prefer a more casual place to enjoy locally crafted beer, so that is what I am basing my 3 star rating on, I am sure there are people out there that are bigger fans of more upscale places, just not me.  So please take my review with that disclaimer  Place is aesthetically very nice, the beer was good, the pizzas were very good, the s'mores were good too, i guess, not a big s'mores fan.  Definitely a place to try, but know walking in that this isn't a typical brew-pub.  Oh yeah, one tip for the place, get shades for the windows, the sun was blinding us."
"Coatesville, PA",11/16/2014,4.0,"Very, very good. Excellent beer. Great food. Good service. La Colombe coffee. We had the rye IPA, fingerling potatoes and Brussels sprouts, duck confit salad and wild mushroom salad. We took a lot of food home, along with one of the new sailed steel growlers with more of the IPA. Park in the back. Go here. You will be glad you did."
"Philadelphia, PA",10/26/2016,4.0,"Beer was good, food was good.  A great place to eat lunch and grab a drink!"
"Ambler, PA",10/1/2016,4.0,So glad I stopped in for a bite here. Loved the interior and bar area. Good gastro menu that included a good variety of healthy options along with burgers etc. Tried the kolsch beer that hit the spot with their pizza margarita.  I'd definitely go back!
"Queens, NY",8/25/2014,5.0,"After our crazy night at The Vault, I was contacted by James, one of the owners who apologized for that evening and invited my family and I back to give them another try.  We decided to head over for lunch on saturday.  It was restaurant week in yardley so 3 of the 4 of us got the fixed menu which was a salad or soup, pizza, & one of their s'mores.  We also had several beers.  All the food was great, I personally love the Brow Sugar Buffalo pizza.  Overall a huge improvement from our first family visit, this time with quick service and really good food.  Having the owners invite us back for another visit showed our first time was a fluke.  We will definitely be making another trip in soon for some drinks and a pizza."
"Morrisville, PA",7/20/2016,2.0,"Vault Brewing company opened in my little town a couple of years ago and while i have, from time to time, found some decent brews there. Mostly they are heavy and sluggish seeming to shoot more for high alcohol content than taste. that being said i do enjoy their stout. My wife and I went there one evening for a couple of beers and to enjoy the summer evening. They have an outdoor seating area crammed between two buildings. when we were escorted to a table by the hostess we, honestly, said we were just there for drinks. we were told the tables were only for customers ordering food and were then ushered over to an area in which we were allowed to stand and told, quite curtly, that we could get drinks from the bar if we wanted them. so, left to stand in the sun and wade through the bar to order drinks we chose instead to go home where we could enjoy our choice of beer and wine...the wines at the vault are only from Pennsylvania and, all due respect, are mostly undrinkable.It's in our town and there are very few choices so I'm sure we'll be back but I would just hope they would be a little more friendly and shed the hipster vibe their obviously going for in this Philadelphia bedroom community."
"Newtown, PA",1/26/2015,5.0,Really great place in Newtown to meet friends and family for a fun dinner.  Entire table shared many different beers and the were all very good.
"Winter Park, FL",4/4/2015,4.0,Nice little bar to go to if your looking for a relaxing night out and good beer!
"Philadelphia, PA",1/6/2015,3.0,"I went here for dinner with a party of five for dinner.  The wait was about an hour but that's to be expected for a Saturday night.  The beer was pretty good although I only tried the Belgian blonde.  The food was pretty good but not great.  I was a little disappointed b/c they didn't offer fries or any fried food for that matter.  I finda felt they were trying too hard with the food and need to add some more ""typical"" bar food to the menu like a burger and fries.  Service was ok, no issues but not great."
"Newtown, PA",11/7/2016,5.0,"If you want to be guaranteed great food, beer and service then Vault Brewing is your place.  Been a regular here since we discovered it over a year ago.  We love the selection of craft beers and quality food.  Never had a bad meal nor experience although do wish the bar area could accommodate more people but well worth the wait regardless."
"Philadelphia, PA",5/16/2016,3.0,"This place was mediocre as breweries go. The beer was ok, but nothing spectacular and certainly nothing I would seek out. The food was really disappointing. I got a burger for $14 that came with ""fries"" aka greasy pieces of potato that were not fried. Two people in our party got Cuban sandwiches that did not come with any side at all. The pizza looked like it would have been a better option for the price but I didn't taste it. We got $6 s'mores for dessert (our fault?) that looked and tasted worse than something you'd make in the microwave. The food overall was just ok but WAY overpriced especially for the area. We spent $70 all in for a sandwich with no sides, a burger with mushy ""fries,"" 1 flight of beer, 1 regular beer and the s'mores. If you're in the mood for brew pub food and bevs, there are MUCH better options in the Philly burbs."
"Los Altos, CA",11/1/2016,5.0,"Great service, romantic atmosphere, friendly.  Had the best beet salad ever, and the thin crust pizza was excellent.  Beer is fine, but the food and service are perfect."
"Philadelphia, PA",8/11/2016,3.0,"Bought a one liter, double insulated stainless bottle/growler of stout after a taste. Great beer! The bottle was dented so the bar took the cost of the vessel and I only paid for the beer since I was in too much of a hurry for another pour.  One caveat. The method of sealing employed on this fancy schmancy stainless bottle does not provide a tight seal, and beer that normally stays carbonated for up to a week will not stay fresh in this container. The best method of sealing is a simple glass growler with a metal cap, under coated with thermoplastic, tightly screwed, and finished by the bartender with a couple inches of electrical tape around the circumference. Sounds crude, but the best microbreweries I visit eschew the fancy stainless (which brings a hefty price, and no doubt a handsome profit to the seller) for a good old fashioned bottle. I've kept beer fresh for a week, even checked it for flights around the country. This is why customers buy growlers, so they can share the freshness with friends days later. Vault should stick to what works and forget the glitzy appeal or upgrade the seal."
"Ewing Township, NJ",11/14/2014,4.0,"Love the beer selection. Good range, from IPAs to ales to stouts. Seasonal brews alone make it worth the trip. Service consistently friendly. Always like the live music performers. Only reason didn't give 5 stars is food has become iffy. My last three visits I've been disappointed. Seasonal pizzas each time. Stick to the mushroom or Margherita. Haven't had a sandwich or salad. See website for parking suggestions. Vault Brewing has invigorated Yardley and is greatly appreciated and thankfully patronized heartily. Take your date here confidently."
"Levittown, PA",11/9/2014,4.0,Great beer selection and great food. Was there this past Friday night and split an appetizer (large Antipasta Board) and 2 pizzas (Wild Mushroom & Brown Sugar Buffalo)...good food and definitely worth the hour wait. We each had a flight of beer and when the bill came I was surprised at the total...a good surprise! Will definitely be back!
"Manhattan, NY",11/29/2013,4.0,"wish it was closer to me.... like in my kitchen!Great atmosphere, good ambience, attentive staff, food is AMAZING. have not had this great of food with a fair value price point in a VERY long time. Great job guys!must haves:  lamb balls, brown sugar pizza, charcuterie board.  just real great consistent quality food in my experiences.  sorry to see the bad reviews but that is why YELP is here and hopefully can improve on its mistakes because this is a must try restaurant for anyone within a 45 min radius."
"Morrisville, PA",3/28/2016,1.0,"I was hoping I'd like this convenient, local brew pub but the waitress was slow as molasses and the food, which sounded delicious in the menu descriptions, was absolutely nothing to go back for.  All three of us were thoroughly unimpressed by our meals.  Now that is sad !  None of us will be going back.  Such a disappointment.  Fortunately The Continental is on the next corner with a full bar and really really good sandwiches etc."
"Jersey City, NJ",8/18/2014,5.0,"Excellent atmosphere, the food was great, and had some of the finest beer that I've ever had. All-around worth the trip!"
"Newtown, PA",7/19/2013,2.0,"The brew is average; the American Blonde has a great citrus with it. Despite this, the overall venue lacks an identity. Is it a jazz club, brew pub, cardboard pizza, or something else? The place does have a cool rustic appearance to it, but that is about the positives for this venue lies. The venue is very choppy and lacks an open floor plan that is a most for any successful bar. The place is too small to house a consistent flow of adequate musicians and artists. Not only that, what gasps me is the overarching prices for their growlers. They charge $36 for a growler fill, absolutely absurd if you ask me. When I asked the manager about this charge and why Triumph charges a mere $15-18 fill (with growler included) it is due to the aluminum can being more conducive for the beer. I am sorry, but this is not Tremens, filling above average beer into what Vault believes to be a vastly superior growler does not make up for C+/B- beer.  Lastly, the bar tender pouring my growler had no experience, it took the man nearly 15 minutes to fill a growler, where at Triumph it takes a mere 5 minutes. The guy could not figure out how to work the tap with a growler and eventually the manager had to help. The lack of beer knowledge amongst the staff and service is trifling. I suggest that people drive to New Hope and spend their hard earned money and time at Triumph for a significantly better experience. I will say that their desserts are excellent, but this place I know is new needs to look at themselves in the mirror and re-evaluate what they are."
"Robbinsville, NJ",6/3/2013,2.0,"I hope I never stumble across other places its reviewers frequent since the majority of people seem to find this to be an acceptable hangout. Not to be bitchy but I feel that this place sucks. Also, Vault, I would like to note that I had continued hope for you after a disappointing introduction. But you knew you were up for online review when you opened your gimmicky, discombobulated doors. You knew you would be rated when you charged me $6 for a beer since opening night. Basically, I hold strong on my initial review. BAD atmosphere, small and awkward space, lighting is too bright, jazz is too elevator. (I would bet the radio is just on some xm jazz station.) I just really don't enjoy it. I literally feel like someone opened it because they thought it would be a cash cow. I know now I wont be back a third time in hopes that anything has improved. Oh also their beer is intolerable."
"Merion Station, PA",5/6/2015,4.0,Great food and an awesome variety of home crafted beers.  The atmosphere and decor are interesting.  I would recommend this place for almost anyone.
"Langhorne, PA",4/27/2014,5.0,This place is amazing!!!! An absolute must visit! It is very chic and an awesome place to hang out! Their BlackBerry blonde beer is delish!!!!! The hummus platter and the cheese fondue an absolute must order!!!!! The menu is not very large but the items available are very different which makes it stand out from other restaurants! I definitely recommend this restaurant!!!!!
"Morrisville, PA",11/16/2013,3.0,"The cheese platter is delicious, and if the duck confit is available get it. Avoid the steak salad, the meat tasted ""off"".... Good Pinot noir, although skimpy on the pouring. Live jazz Thurs, Fri and Sat until 11pm if you like that. A little pricey too, but good atmosphere."
"Philadelphia, PA",7/28/2013,3.0,"We came here yesterday for a few beers and an early dinner.   The beers-awesome!  We tried the American Blonde and the IPA-very fresh and great flavor.  The ambiance-equally awesome!  Love the revived old bank-beautifully decorated.  However-the downside for us was the food.  We started with the hummus trio-completely bland and teeny tiny portions.  This was followed by the Vegetarian Panini. It was completely greasy and drowned in butter-not our cup of tea.  We also ordered the sandwich with no cheese which didn't happen-it was equally drowned in cheese.   I at least was attempting to detox from butter and grease by ordering a side salad which never came,  After that we were ready to go-come for the beer, not the food."
"Morrisville, PA",12/22/2013,5.0,"Respect. Vault has become iconic because of the creativity and force behind the product.  Food has gone to another level as well as the service and beer,of course. Totally impressed the last time with the hummus trio and doughy goodness of wood fired bread for dipping. Amazing. Jazz music. Check. It was ON the night we were there. Good guys from Philly, I believe. Well done."
"Newtown, PA",10/10/2016,5.0,ABSOLUTE FAV! We've been many times and have enjoyed everything we've had. We especially going in late and sharing a cheese board. The beer selection is great. Be sure to drop in on a Tuesday night for Trial & Error beer tasting. We love this place.
"Bensalem, PA",7/1/2016,3.0,"The worst problem is that the don't take reservations. We were a party of 8. I got there 1/2 hour earlier than my group in order to circumvent a long wait. No joy. Once they arrived, we waited an additional 40 minutes. I won't be back and neither will they. It's not worth the wait."
"Bensalem, PA",11/30/2013,2.0,"The food was delicious but not worth the hassle we encountered.  They don't take reservations but we called ahead for a party of 6.  When we arrived we were told it would be a 45 minute wait.  After 45 minutes we were then told it would be another 30 minutes.  Then they couldn't seat our whole group together.  Then the waitress told one of our group that they didn't have diet soda; but another girl in our group (at a separate table because they couldn't seat our group together) had gotten a diet Pepsi.  It took forever to order and get our meals, which explains why the wait was so long.  Food was delicious but we will NOT be back."
"Furlong, PA",12/19/2013,1.0,"I'm having mixed feelings about writing this review since I haven't had any food or drink at Vault. But I can't get over the silly and short experience I had and I'm a little stressed from xmas shopping all day! I'll keep it simple. How does a restaurant run out of gift cards a less than a week before xmas??!?!?!?!? The Vault was my last stop of a log day of shopping. And for what it's worth....The answer is Nooooooo. I didn't wait till the last minuet, my wife did. An since I'm a house husband in the winter when I'm not farming I get to shop between loads of laundry! So why would I got back? If they can't accomplish a simple task like keeping enough gift cards in stock what else are they less than proficient in? Plus it's almost an hour round trip for me. I wonder if Triumph has gift cards or is there an east coast shortage like chicken wings before the super bowl!"
"Langhorne, PA",7/24/2016,5.0,"Great locally sourced seasonal food, impeccable service, quality brews. I've never had a bad experience here. They don't do reservations because it's a small old historic bank and they simply can't accommodate. Very understandable but they are cool of you call ahead and be like hey I'll be there in 15 min, how is the wait? It's a bit pricy for some but many micro-brew-pubs are. Everything is small batch stuff too. Some days you have to wait so if your starving walk down to Continental Tavern and see how that wait is, that's a great place for dinner also. Also Vault allows kids but is not kid friendly because we'll it's a brew pub, I would never think of bringing my kids to a place like this."
"Manchester Township, NJ",2/12/2014,5.0,Beer was excellent.  Food was excellent.  Atmosphere excellent.  Yeah it was a good experience.  We had the mushroom pizza and then the italian sausage pizza.  The antipasti and then finished with a smores.
"BELLE MEAD, NJ",9/13/2016,5.0,Great beer and really cool atmosphere.  Pizzas are excellent.  Love the sweet potato ale
"Newtown, PA",11/9/2012,4.0,"We're are so excited that there is a new place to hang out in Yardley! Staff is so friendly and attentive. We went there last Saturday around 9 and the place was totally packed. We had about a 45 minute wait, which is fine...as I sai it was a Saturday night. We were waiting in the vestibule and 3 different staffers (I think one might have been the owner) came over to check on us, giving us status updates and offering to get us drinks from the bar...very nice. The servers are all dressed like 20s flappers or gangsters, which is a little cheesy, but on the plus side make them very easy to identify in a crowded restaurant:)The decor is great: The atmosphere is really cool. They kept alot of elements from when the building was a bank and it totally works. Decor had a lot of interesting details that were conversation starters.The food was great, but menu too limited: All their menu items incorporate this awesome pita bread they make with their beer...very delicious, served warm and fresh! We've been there twice and have already exhausted the menu. I like their idea of doing a few things really well, but maybe a few more options, or specials or even a dessert option or two? The Beer is pretty good: I'm not a beer drinker but my husband had the flight both times we've been there. He says the beers are consistantly good, but nothing blows him away (He did mention that they have the only coffee stout he has ever liked, though.) I imagine that it takes awhile to develop great beer, so we have high hopes for future:) The wine is very good, btw) Bottom Line: Vault is off to a solid start and worth the trip!"
"Manhattan, NY",2/11/2013,2.0,"I visited this place with a fellow microbrew fan, and, considering it was local and had casks, checking it out was a no brainer. The interior was very neat, and provided that perfect combination of old-fashioned and eclectic, as well as a perfect view of the fermenting tanks so you can see what is going to be on tap upon your next visit. The bar was small and provided an intimate area for one to converse with a friend. The tables, mainly consisting of high tops, had these neat looking but very uncomfortable metal seats that could have been kinder to one's posterior, and made it very awkward to place your coat upon them, as they didn't have a back.  The bathrooms, while hard to find, were immaculate and accepting of equines as well as humans (see the horse head on the wall).They had 4 beers on tap when we visited yesterday afternoon, and as a self proclaimed afficianado, I decided to try all 4 over pleasant conversation with a fellow beer fan. The Belgian Blonde, my first choice, was on the whole disappointing; flat, flavorless, and bland. My second, the German Hefeweisen, tasted oddly similar; very flat, bland, and if you blindfolded me, I probably couldn't have told you the difference. Their ESB was also flat, and not bitter, and reminded me of a brown spot on an apple when it came to taste. The crown jewel, however, was definitely their Russian Imperial Stout, which had great aromatics, but alas, an B- taste, making it the best. I was hoping that their IPA would have been ready upon my arrival, but it was not.We split a ""classic"" pizza, cooked in a wood burning stove made out of an old fermenting tank, keeping up with the microbrew theme. It was definitely the highlight of the visit; thin crust, smokey, crisp, and ""just enough"" for something to munch on while drinking our brews.The service was knowledgeable on the products they were selling and able to answer any questions we had down to the type of yeast and hops used in each beer. This, even in the microbrew world, was a pleasant treat. My only concern was that they were somewhat pushy; we had servers come up to us 4 times asking if we wanted to put a food order in, though they were very polite.In conclusion, I'd like to try this place again in a few months, to see if they've improved at all, but as for now, it's not a place I could recommend to friends."
"Morrisville, PA",7/6/2016,5.0,Awesome place! The food is amazing and so is the decor.
"Newtown, PA",10/12/2013,5.0,Best locally brewed beer in Yardley / Newtown area. The food is great. They have a small menu buts it's all great. The sometimes have a small jazz trio which is nice and not too loud and in the way of your conversation. The staff is also really friendly and happy.
"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",11/16/2015,5.0,"When I first saw this place I had my speculations. But when I found out that this place used to be a bank I figured, heck I'll try it out. First and foremost I have to point out that this place is dog friendly which is fabulous. I rarely leave my house without my Yorke, Benjamin. As soon as I walked in the entire restaurant was admiring him and his cute little outfit I bought him. An Armani suit fitted for a dog; only the finest for him . This placed was dazzling with culture and the ambience was fit for a king. Their wine selection was choice. It reminded me of the time I was at the Hamptons with my wife Veronica. Benjamin and I ordered the steak pizza which tasted as if it were imported straight out of the temples of Rome. Upon request the pizza came out with only half of it made with cheese, as Benjamin is lactose intolerant. So if you are ever in the area when your not in your vacation home in Bel Are or in your Penthouse sweet in Manhattan I strongly recommend this place!"
"Morrisville, PA",10/21/2012,4.0,"Decided to visit on a Sunday at opening (noon) to beat the crowds.  My husband & I were the 1st people in the place, so we got to look around and had our choice of tables.  Very nice staff & atmosphere.We both ordered flights of beer.  I got the Blonde, Hefeweizen, Sweet Potato Ale (my favorite), Coffee Stout (2nd favorite).  My husband got the ESB, Blonde, Hefeweizen & Coffee Stout (his favorite).  The beers were good, but my husband couldn't get the IPA (they were out) and the Sweet Potato All was running low.  The food menu was limited, but that was ok.  The tapas were fresh with great flavor, but a little small for the price.  We had 3 of the 4 pizzas (Brown Sugar Buffalo, Margharita & Cured Classic).  All very good.  Our waitress Adriana was great.  Very helpful with lots of information.  Also, the father of the owners was great, coming around and asking how things were going.  You could tell they really care about doing a good job.The jazz duo was good too.  This is a nice addition to Yardley."
"Langhorne, PA",6/20/2016,5.0,This is one of my favorite places to go in this area. It is definitely a great date night spot. The buffalo prosciutto pizza and the pork belly fries are a must! Never a disappointment.
"South Bend, IN",6/18/2016,5.0,"Delicious. Was able to sit out side. Ordered cheese board, brown sugar buffalo pizza, brisket sandwich. I think this is some of the best food locally!"
"Princeton, NJ",2/15/2013,4.0,"Just two brothers who love beer and decided to start up this operation - it's clearly a labor of love, but also nicely put together. The beer snob husband was quite pleased with what's on tap, including the option of hand-pulled cask ales (aka beer engine beers). He recommends the Russian Imperial Stout next time it's in the rotation. The pizza was also tasty, though the options would be wider if they allowed for substitutions (we just wanted meat toppings on half and not the other, but we settled just fine on margherita when that wasn't possible). Ask to sit on the couches or couple more comfortable chairs - the metal perch looking ones look really uncomfortable. Also of note: American Homebrew Association members get a discount, so I'll round up to 4 stars for that. It's probably closer to 3.5."
"Philadelphia, PA",8/2/2015,5.0,"Made my first visit today, and I'm glad I did.  I was limited to only one beer (was out on the motorcycle), but the Centennial ale was great.  As for the food, I'm not sure who came up with the idea of mixing brown sugar into buffalo sauce for a pizza, but they're a freaking genius.  It was really delicious, and something different that I've never heard of before.  Add in a fresh, perfectly-sized side salad for A DOLLAR, coupled with friendly service and a nice atmosphere, and this place earns every one of the 5 stars I'll give it.  Highly recommended; I'll definitely be back."
"Yardley, PA",11/18/2015,4.0,"We continue to go here because we live in the neighborhood, and I'm happy to report that it has gotten better since my last review (5/2014). Even if you don't like beer, you might go here just for the food, because they have really evened things out at a pretty high level, and many of the dishes are kind of cool and different. We just had their cauliflower soup and their Thanksgiving Dinner pizza and they were both five-stars delicious, couldn't be better. The service was also much better than what we'd experienced in the past, and it has been better for about the last three visits over the past year. We only had one of the beers on our most recent visit and it was one of their regulars (Chinook IPA), and it was good, but still not great, just a little soft on flavor. It was the same way the last time we got a flight: one beer was good, three were meh, and one was huh?. It's like if they just bailed on the brewery and put in taps of excellent beer this place would kick ass. But we don't hesitate to go here, because the food, interior, and service are all really good now. They got a fourth star because they have NO TVs! So suck on it, sports bars!"
"Merchantville, NJ",5/27/2016,4.0,Best chicken sandwich I've ever had.  All the food was amazing.    Beer.   Is a 3.  Lack of flavor profile stout Very thin like water.   I will come back.   The food was great and beer is nice.
"Yardley, PA",10/5/2013,5.0,The best! The pizza is fantastic and the buffalo cauliflower is relish! I can't wait to go back.ps. the beer is WONDERFUL
"Bloomfield, NJ",5/22/2016,4.0,"Food was great! They balanced ingredients really good and everything came out quick, hot, and yummy! Good selection of beer and wine, pairs really well with the pizza. But, it's pretty pricey for the middle of nowhere PA."
"Trenton, NJ",3/6/2016,5.0,"Great food and beer! Been here several times, no complaints about service. Be sure to try the duck and apple pizza - we come here just for that. The plain pizza is great too and the servers always ask if you want the balsamic glaze on it, even though it's clearly mentioned in the description, which is nice."
"Trenton, NJ",8/29/2014,4.0,"They did it!  The Vault got together with the health dept. and now officially allows well-behaved dogs on the deck!  Judging from the reaction on Facebook, that's welcome news to area dog owners.  Thanks, Vault!!facebook.com/VaultBrewin…"
"Yardley, PA",11/21/2012,5.0,"First things first- Wow. Beautiful. James you did it right. Thank you for the great talk. It was awesome meeting you and the brothers.   Food, live music, and hand crafted beer from a cask pump. Love it! Also, families run business as well. That is a rare thing these days. What else can you ask for Brother John? Customer service was out of this world.  The pies are amazing and I was lucky enough to be a guinea pig on some new sandwiches in beta test even after the kitchen closed. The decor, atmosphere, open design flow is gorgeous.  James and company cosmetically worked in the history of the building's architecture originally occupied by 4-5 banks, with BOA being the last stop. The colors work in concert with Vaults Brewing Company not only on the palette of your mouth, but also visually stunning to even further excite your taste buds.  Folks with the 2-3 stars, I challenge you below to educate yourself a bit ore, give t another shot and see how you feel.  I am not putting you down, as I also started in the same place.  However, micro brews made in the US accounts for less than 5% of gross beer sales.  The industry is dominated by conglomeration of big boys  Anheuser-Busch, who owns, Stella, Bass, Becks, Boddingtons, even some craft beer praisers like Goose Island; Miller who owns Peroni, Nastro Azurro, Pilsner Urquell, Molson; Coors owns Grolsch, Blue Moon, Zima. Combined they're over 300 of the major beer labels spilling more beer a day then some micro brews make in a year.  FYI- Anheuser-Busch, the 5th, sold out- No longer American after they acquired and crushed Latrobe, and rolling rock for profits and killed the '33"". James brought in the dream team to a much-welcomed neighbor of beer connoisseurs and beer/wine drinkers.

It has its own personality, language, and terms. As important as distribution is to the success of a brewer, it is very important to learn this industry so that you are comfortable and knowledgeable enough to make it work for you. You can brew the very best of products, with great packaging and pricing, but without good distribution, it will be not be enjoyed by the end consumer. Your main three distributors are Bush, Miller, and Coors. If you caught on, the big 3 monopolize the industry and deprive you, of your favorite brew.  Go to California and ask for a lager, they won't give you Yuengling!  Distribution and old practices is why you can't find the beer you love if you ever moved or traveled a lot.   If you do not know much about beer, here are a few documentaries found on Netflix:-Empires of Industry: Brewed in America, History channel- While the brewing of beer isn't the oldest profession, it certainly ranks up there when it comes to activities that have withstood the test of time.

"Langhorne, PA",7/23/2016,4.0,GREAT food! Attentive waitstaff. BEER! Live background music.
"Jenkintown, PA",1/3/2015,1.0,"FAIL. After a call ahead and a supposed 30 minute wait, it took two hours before we were eating anything. My friend's food never even came and we had to tell the waitress this. She came back a few minutes later to tell us ""the kitchen skipped right over it."" He got his food when the rest of us were done. Didn't really apologize or take any money off the bill. Douche factor was through the roof. I'll never go there again."
"Morrisville, PA",10/27/2012,4.0,"When have been DYING for the Vault to open!  We were finally able to get in here on a Friday night. There are a couple things to note about the Vault before going. Sometimes my husband and I like to take our 3 year old to dinner with us on a Friday or Saturday night. The Vault is definitely not kid friendly. No kids there. Certainly not kid friendly. Glad we left our little one at home. If you are looking for a big menu with ample food options, the Vault is definitely not for you. The specialized menu is nice, however, you might be disappointed to get there and be presented with limited options. No utensils, no table condiments, no frills. The food is all finger food served on paper and wooden blocks. The concept is to eat with your hands, small bites, and walk around and enjoy the decor of this historic bank that was converted into a brewery. All good, however, the vision is not really stated anywhere except the website, so we came across a lot of confused patrons. The menu isn't forgiving to vegetarians or vegans. The dough is vegan, however unless you want a sweet pizza, the only other option is the margherita pizza with no cheese. The pizza is very good.  The crust is cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the sweet sopressata dry salami and Layla and the white mint pizza. The pizza had a little too much olive oil, but overall four stars. The sweet sopressata and cheese selected from a local creamery was delicious. Carefully selected ingredients is what we look for in a dish--the Vault hit a home run in this category for us. The layout of the restaurant is a little awkward. If you are waiting for a table, there is no good place to stand. We were knocked and nudged for the 30 minutes we waited for our table. The concept doesn't lend for bars tools, however, bars stools would be nice. Finger food and getting comfy at the bar perhaps?  Sounds delightful!  We felt the layout needs to be ironed out. The bust boys were lugging clean wooden blocks from one side of the restaurant to the next, nudging and knocking people along the way. It was also very crowded, as expected, because they just opened and people are excited to come here!Overall, we enjoyed our experience at the Vault. The missing star is for the kinks (awkward layout, no barstools, unwelcoming experience if you are waiting for a table) and the limited menu for dietary restrictions only (more vegan/vegetarian options would be nice). The food is phenomenal. The quality and ingredients are top notch. The decor is unique and lends to an enjoyable experience--good food, good music!  We will definitely try the Vault again!"
"Morrisville, PA",7/11/2016,3.0,The food is pretty good.  I have seen a few decent jazz bands here.   The problems are that is usually too crowded to get great service and too loud to even enjoy.
"Morrisville, PA",3/28/2014,4.0,Pretty cool place! The jazz is sweet! You can tell they are dedicated to the craft! A great addition to Yardley!
"Morrisville, PA",9/3/2014,5.0,"I'm surprised the Vault only has 3.5 stars overall.  I've been coming to this place since it opened.  Probably been here 30 or 40 times now.  Great pizzas, the crabcake sliders are AWESOME, and the beer is always excellent.  They always have a good IPA and a good stout on tap. If you are a craft beer lover, this is a great place to go.   I stop in a lot to fill my growler and grab a quick pint... but also for lunch or dinner.Also, they are always trying new stuff, slighting altering the menu, offering bottled beers on Sunday (always something new). There are NO TV's on the wall, so don't expect this to be a sports bar... it's not.  It's a place that affords an actual conversation!The staff is always friendly and outgoing.  Great attitudes abound!I really love it here!   Great job guys!"
"Chicago, IL",9/18/2013,3.0,"Went last night for a quick bite and a beer. Very cool layout and atmosphere. This is something Yardley definitely needed, especially since the only other real option is the continental tavern which is pretty brutal. The beer was tasty and the service was good. We shared the pork panini and a buffalo flatbread. Panini was nice but the flatbread was gross. Barely edible. Stay away from that thing and you're good to go. Hopefully they keep updating the menu."
"Trenton, NJ",6/5/2016,4.0,"Finally got around to trying this place out. I did exactly what everyone suggested and ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower and was not disappointed.  Wasn't too crazy about the pizza, but maybe it was just the one we ordered. I'll definitely be back to try a few other pies."
"Philadelphia, PA",5/26/2016,5.0,The pizzas are amazing. The duck and apple pie is our favorite. They always have new beers on tap and the growler prices are very fair.
"Newtown, PA",5/24/2016,4.0,"Everything about this place (food, beer, service) is great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the bar only has six seats. If you don't plan to sit at the bar, you can't beat the Vault."
"Morrisville, PA",6/13/2017,3.0,"This is a much needed restaurant in Yardley.  An old bank building (Vault,) makes it very interesting.  And the outside deck is a great way to enjoy this cute town.  The food is usually good.  I would stay away from the Hummus app., but the flatbreads are really good.  The bartenders here always make me feel at home.  I sit at the bar sometimes, and even when they are busy they are attentive!   This is great because they always seem very busy.  They are great with getting to know my taste, and suggesting things I should try.  The beer is very good, and I know good beer, and the wine is OK.  But the hostess and some of the rules here really can be an issue.  In the Spring they would not send a server out to the deck (even though it was packed,) so I had to get up and go to the bar inside!  Two weeks ago I found an empty table on the deck, and went inside to let the hostess know, and she acted like I was breaking the law having my girlfriend sit in it.  There was nobody waiting for a outside table.  It makes you feel like you are inconveniencing them.  But don't let that keep you away.  This can be a great first date night, as there is often live music, the food is good.  Don't go here in a rush as the foodservice is not fast.  It is not the place to go if your alone, as the set-up is not good for meeting others, and most people are couples, or groups.  Wait staff is usually very nice (wish I could remember the last young blonde guy who waited on us.)  When I suggest to my girlfriend that we go here she is happy, but always remembers how ""unwelcome"" we feel when we first arrive.  I really hope they read this, and speak to her, as it is the  only issue, in an otherwise great place."
"Morrisville, PA",10/16/2012,4.0,"The beer is wonderful especially the cask conditioned IPA and ESB. Looking forward to their other beers as they roll them out. The glasses they serve the beer in seem small, maybe 14 oz, at $6 it make it seem a little steep.The decor is upscale and a great addition to Yardley Borough.The limited menu of pizza and a few tapas dishes works yet I wish it was a little bigger. Staff are friendly but the host was a little cold and in your face. Been twice, want to go back,"
"Newtown, PA",11/12/2012,4.0,"Great concept in Yardley. The service is good and the food is good. A little loud. They should put in some throw rugs to absorb some of the sound. My wife ordered the Tascano Salami appetizer and I ordered the $12  Margarita pizza about 8"". They were good."
"Westford, MA",10/31/2012,5.0,"If you really understand the art of beer making, thoughtful food creations, and the real objective of the pub concept- you are going to love this place.Fortunate to have traveled the world, I have got to say that I think these folks thought through everything and gathered the best hardware, make the best consumables, and empower YOU to generate an atmosphere and attitude that celebrates spending times with friends while making new ones.We all know the chain restaurant types- they won't know where to begin.  But if you convince them to not expect a glossy 12x24 menu with 15 salads and various freezer to fryer options while being cornered by TV's- you will give another human a breakthrough- this is the place to sit back and enjoy a drink, a bite, and a conversation.Go enjoy this place- these folks are doing something special."
"Ringoes, NJ",10/6/2013,3.0,"I really wanted this place to be awesome because I live so close, and it does have a good brewery vibe, but there are a few hopeful improvements that could be changed."
"Norfolk, VA",12/23/2012,4.0,"I visited Vault Brewing CO yesterday afternoon for a bite to eat and some micro brews;  the place is fairly nice but there is not enough bar seating as I had to stand at the bar.  The beer was good, we sample the American stout, dunkelweissen, coffee stout, all were very good.  The bartender was fairly knowledgeable regarding their offerings.  I would like to see a couple of improvements and that is the seating at the bar, there should be more of it and also it would be nice to be greeted at the bar when you walk in.  The wood fired pizzas are great.  All in all the place is a little expensive but the Vault does offer good service, good beer, and good food."
"Thornton, CO",4/9/2016,4.0,Super friendly staff...fun crowd..local feel...parking in rear is huge plus...great bartenders...
"St Augustine, FL",10/25/2012,5.0,"My experience with vault brewing has been great. Quality food and even better atmosphere make dining at the vault an absolute pleasure. Anytime you have a chance to go to an independently owned restaurant it is exciting, and vault brewing exemplifies this. The beer here is second to none and the experience overall has more than lived up to my expectations. I will definitely be visiting the vault again."
"New Hope, PA",2/24/2013,5.0,"Fantastic addition to Yardley! We have been coming to the Vault since opening day in October 2012 and have very much enjoyed watching the growth of this new local brewery. I have tried all the beers that have been released thus far but my favorites are the Belgian Blonde, the Sweet Potato Ale and the Rye IPA. The Blonde reminds me of a beautiful summer day in the sunshine as it's so refreshing, the Sweet Potato is just an awesome idea and so creamy and smoothe to drink, and the Rye IPA is a new take on my very favorite type of brew. The menu for food is perfectly simple and fun to eat. The atmosphere is unique and a new concept for a typical brew pub with no tv's, more dim lighting, high ceilings in a cool old bank building, and great jazz music. We love all the bartenders and the owners that we have met so far and special shout-outs to Nick, Rich, Michael and John! All in all a fantastic addition to the Yardley community and a welcome one!"
"Morrisville, PA",3/20/2016,5.0,"My husband and I go to the vault all the time. I don't drink beer but I Love their food, so while my husband enjoys the beer I enjoy a glass of wine & their amazing pizzas! People complain about the prices but the quality of the food speaks for itself. No pizza places in yardley compare to the vault. I'm so happy the vault is 5 mins away from us."
"Levittown, PA",2/9/2016,5.0,Absolutely amazing. Place has a great atmosphere. Nice craft beer selection. Small menu but everything we had was awesome. I mean the food was soooooo good. Went on a friday around 4 seated right away but noticed around 5 place starts to get busy. One of the best places in the area. Will for sure be returning.
"Morrisville, PA",10/13/2015,2.0,"It's been awhile since I last reviewed The Vault.  As a longtime homebrewer, I really wanted to like the place, since it's my local brewpub.  I've been here about 10-12 times.  I've wanted to like the beers, but most of the time have left feeling let down.  The food offerings are usually OK.  I've had about everything on the menu and never left saying I had a bad meal, but at the same time, never left saying I had a great meal.  The ambiance is nice, for a date.  Recently they started the Trial and Error program, where the brewer experiments with new beers.  They send out emails to advertise.  Today, I finally received a notice of a beer that I thought I would like.  I drove a fair distance out of my way to go down there on this particular night.  The bartender greeted me and politely told me they would not sell me a growler of it, as it was only sold in 4 oz glasses.  This is definitely something that should have been put in the advertisements.  I'm afraid that I won't be going back anytime soon.  And I really don't like posting negative reviews...but if a friend asked me, this is what I'd tell em."
"Levittown, PA",1/28/2016,4.0,"Great food, beer and atmosphere.   A bit loud in the dining room when it's a full house."
"Ewing Township, NJ",11/27/2012,4.0,"Pizza was excellent. Served quickly with a fine suggestion from server.  Beer was good, recommend the IPA."
"Washington Crossing, PA",12/23/2015,3.0,Good but unispiring. Nothing is bad but nothing is a rave either. Gave them 3 shots didnt knock me out. Servers i had didnt know the product didnt know the cheeses on the cheese board and obviously hadnt tasted the beer. With the outdoor seating now there can be a pleasant stop for a drink.
"Brunswick, MD",9/3/2013,2.0,"My husband and I checked this place out Saturday evening.  The atmosphere was great.  I enjoyed the beer.  We were excited to see a cheese plate and charcuterie plate on the menu, which we ordered.  The servings were great, including an enormous prosciutto rosette.  I particularly loved the chevre from Washington Crossing.  We placed our order for our flatbread, a ricotta sun-dried tomato, prepared in the bake oven.  Everything was great to this point.  We had barely made our way into our appetizers when the flatbread arrived.  This is unfortunate.  I really wish the servers would have considered the timing and waited till we were finished.  Our table was small, intimate.  Normally I like this, but a 2' x 2' table does not support all these dishes.  I told our server we weren't ready for it, and she told me that they didn't have anywhere to keep it!  So, the interruption to consolidate plates and make room was frustrating.  By the time we were ready for our flatbread it was cold.  My water was never refilled, either.Basically, the servers need to time tickets better, and the chefs need to recognize when to send dishes out for tables."
"Morrisville, PA",11/9/2012,4.0,"We went to Vault one week after their opening on a Friday night. The space was attractive, hip and warmly lit. Nice details including the copper pizza oven, the beer tanks, and the use of a bank vault for wine storage to name a few. There was a good vibe with the music and mix of locals, beer geeks and suburbanites seeking a new drinking spot. Clearly, I am not a beer snob or I would have a better description for ""beer tank."" I do like beer, though, and enjoyed the lighter offerings. We tried the Blonde, Hefe, IPA, and Sweet Potato. I didn't think the Sweet Potato would be drinkable past a sip or two, but I was wrong. They were all quite tasty!The food was good also. If you haven't read elsewhere, they only serve a few items, so take that into consideration if you are a picky eater. The beet hummus was outstanding, as well as the brown sugar buffalo pizza. Take note - there is no chicken on the buffalo pizza! You won't miss it, though.My only ""complaint"" is the seating in the upper dining area. Guys, you need either taller tables or shorter chairs! Watching men straddle these tables is not attractive at all.We will definitely go back."
"Morrisville, PA",7/1/2014,3.0,First off I can give 3 1/2 stars I would. It was a little packs for a Tuesday night but that didn't really bother me we only waited about 5 to 10 minutes which was nothing and ways seated right away. We ordered the five C's beers which were delicious. And a large anti pasta board. Also we ordered two duck and Apple pizzas. When we got the anti-pasta board it looked a lot smaller than what were used to I was hear a month ago and the same appetizer was literally 50% bigger. We asked the waitress if there was a mixup she said no that is a large appetizer. The quality of it was very good as usual but the actual quantity was very disappointing. The pizzas on the other hand were amazing as usual. When leaving I asked who turned out to be the owner James if they downsized the appetizer board. He said no but he wasn't sure if the decision was made without his knowledge. But I must say he was more than receptive and courteous to us. he was very professional about the manner and actually seem to generally care about our experience at his restaurant. I'm a go ahead and just give the benefit of the doubt to say that there was a mixup in the kitchen about the size of the appetizer and go back a month from now and see if the size stays the same or if it's back to the original size that I remember. The fact that I'm making such a big deal about an appetizer just goes to show you that it was so good that because we ordered a large and they gave us such a small portion it was very disappointing.
"Morrisville, PA",11/30/2012,4.0,"I've been to the Vault four times since they opened in October, and plan to be a regular. It's great to have a new destination in Yardley, and the owners have gone out of their way to create a different atmosphere than anywhere else in the area.The beers are terrific, and the service is friendly and fabulous - and has been since opening weekend. Someone knows how to train their staff from the get-go. Kudos!The menu is limited,, but that's fine, as long as you know that going in. The grilled pizzas are terrific, and the hummus plate is good, too.The atmosphere is MOroccan/old bank/Jazz-not-TVs.The vibe is welcoming, and the crowd ranges from late twenties to folks like myself and my husband -- ""seasoned"" adults.What impressed me the most : they stayed open in the week after Hurricane Sandy! Ran minimal lights on a tiny generator; lit the rest of the place by candlelight; offered menu items they could cook in the wood-fired pizza oven. I love the enterprising spirit here!One tiny suggestion: drapes or louvered doors to block the view of the kitchen would be nice."
"Newtown, PA",12/10/2013,4.0,"This place is great. Excellent selection of quality craft beer and the food was a very tasty added bonus. I don't usually expect much in terms of food from a brewpub but this place rocked. BTW, the Rye IPA was a very solid, flavorful beer. My companions had the Sweet Potato Ale (Nitrous infused), which they also thought was good."
"Yardley, PA",10/25/2012,4.0,Went last night for the first time.  Great addition to Yardley.  Beer was fabulous.  We had a humus appetizer and Pizza & they were wonderful.  Will definitely be back
"Philadelphia, PA",7/30/2015,4.0,Good spot to hangout.. Limited options for crafts maybe this brewery could come up with some more crafts..
"Ewing Township, NJ",7/19/2015,4.0,"Staff was perfectly nice. Food was good, beers were interesting. Overall, I liked this place with the exception of the high-top tables. I really would prefer a traditional seat where my feet touch the ground!"
"Morrisville, PA",7/16/2013,4.0,Love love love this place! The decor is so cool in there and the wait staff and bartenders very friendly. I would give it a 5 but the food isn't amazing. It's just ok. Although it seems like its a place just for beer and some snacks not a dinner.
"Hightstown, NJ",11/4/2015,3.0,Came here in the summer. Lots of fruit flies all around. I was handed a glass of wine that was dripping wet like it was just pulled out of the sink. Our waitress was EXTREMELY unfriendly and looked like she hated her life. We got a cheese and fruit platter with pita bread .. they literally give you 25 pieces of pita bread (I'm not complaining). I've been here 3 times and overall it's OK.
"Morrisville, PA",4/29/2013,5.0,"The more I dine here the more I love this place.  Fantastic ambience, creative menu and fantastic beer.  Try the antipasto board for an app, fig prosciutto pizza, brown sugar buffalo if you can handle 2 and wash them down with a beer sampler if you can't decide.  They are almost there with dessert - the s'mores are a great size but still need some work.  Grab a growler full of your favorite beer from the sampler to take home.  True center city style eatery right in the heart of Yardley."
"Elkins Park, PA",11/24/2012,3.0,"Beers were good, not great.  Their IPA was good, different than any other I've tasted.  I expected more of a punch of flavor from their stout. I didn't . Place is beautiful inside, however the absence of stools at the bar didn't encourage me to sit down and stay for awhile because unless you eat you can't sit down."
"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",12/22/2013,3.0,"Pros: * Delicious beer in Yardley, with an ever-changing selection* Fantastic atmosphere* No obnoxious sports fans* No TVs* Higher-class clientele* Bartenders are fast and efficient.* No ""Thug-life"" trash* Good Social network presence showing new brews, events, food.Cons: * There's no space here. Waitresses are constantly asking people to move around while they navigate the crowd. Friday night is insane.* There's only one crowded bar to get drinks from, unless you want to take a table and wait is even longer for service.* The place is extremely hot inside. Their oven heats the whole place. I started sweating every time I came in.* The service has been spotty. I had a good experience once, and a terrible experience another time.* If you want a drink, getting to the bar to flag the bartender is next to impossible on a busy night. Waiting at the bar opening for a drink is troublesome too, because you're always getting moved around by waitresses who are bussing drinks.* No mixed drinks, wine or brewed beer only.* Food needs to travel through a crowd of patrons before It reaches half of the tables in the restaurant.* The food is overly expensive and portions are small.* Our most recent visit, it took us 10 minutes to get asked for our drinks after being seated, it took another 10 to get them, and 20-minute intervals to come back to our table. Our waitress practically ignored our table. Sorry if we were a small check, but seriously. Whether you're shooting the shit with the guys from the kitchen, or if you're busy doing your hair behind the bar, we're waiting for service. Overall it took 1.5 hours to get a sample of beers for each of us (Table of 2), a single drink for each of us, and a single side plate. It took us 20 minutes to get our check.* Our most recent visit, both of our waitresses were completely miserable, and they were making it known. One waitress told us the other was being ""Cut"" and that she would be our ""New"" waitress. Needless to say, it was a bit overbearing to have the old one come back and say ""Oh I guess you heard I'm leaving""... Please keep your drama on Facebook and out of my dining.Other Thoughts: I was one of the first people who showed interest in this place. I went to the town hall meeting in support of having it here, and I helped campaign a little and spread the good news. I can't say I feel completely let down, because the beer is just fantastic, it'd devoid of ""Bros"", it has lots of working professionals mingling, and the overall operation is professional and responsible. Please hire professional, drama-free staff."
"Philadelphia, PA",8/3/2014,4.0,Yes to The Vault! It's nice to have a decent place to grab beer and dinner when visiting family in the LBC.
"Willow Grove, PA",8/22/2015,3.0,"Have been coming to this young establishment since place opened.  Had pretty decent beers since the get go, they have only improved, and have a great 'trial' Tuesdays special.  Food is different but smells appealing, have not eaten here since my first visit.  My only criticism is that bar has no television and I have always had very poor phone service.  Not the kind of place I would stop in alone for a meal, since I am not the type to talk the bartenders ear off or make small talk with other patrons.  As a big sports fan it deters me from frequenting more often."
"Warrington, PA",6/13/2013,5.0,"Delicious.  Tried it out for lunch while passing through and the tapas were wonderful.  I heard outdoor seating is coming soon, so that will be a bonus."
"Brick, NJ",5/18/2015,3.0,"I dined here over the weekend. This should be 4 stars but the service was JUST.....SO...SLOW. I would understand if they were busy but they were not. We waited longer than quoted for a table as we wanted to sit outside. When I finally asked about our table, the hostess seemed to have forgotten (there were multiple empty tables outside).The waitstaff was friendly and helpful but every time they went away it seemed they were gone forever. The beer selection is on the small side but varied. I didn't try any of the beers this time. We ordered the duck fat fries as an appetizer. They were tasty but seemed to have way more cheese than meat. I had the brisket sandwich and it was DA BOMB. Seriously this sandwich was of out control. It was insanely messy but worth it. Enjoyed a S'more for dessert but not for the 15 plus minutes it took to get it. I would go again when in the area."
"Morrisville, PA",4/13/2013,5.0,"I've been there with mi wife and we love it , Richard was pleasant and adorable waiter . We tried 3 beers and the best  was Belgian Wit which I broth home.Their Fig and Proschiuto Pizza, I should call it flat bread, and Antipasto were  phenomenal.  I've been working in restaurant industry for about 10 years and really recommend this place. They still newly open and still working few things out , but they are doing a good job overall."
"Fairless Hills, PA",12/17/2014,5.0,"Love the beer, love the food, love the atmosphere. Jazz music, an ever-changing menu of interesting specialties, and beer savvy bartenders make this the perfect spot any night of the week. Fri/Sat nights around dinner tend to get crowded but that's to be expected with a place this great. Have a beer while you wait for a text notifying you that a table is ready. Enjoy!"
"Bristol, PA",2/26/2015,5.0,"After about a year or so people talking about this place I decided to give it a try. Stopped in for lunch and upon entering you are automatically at ease in this chic yet sophisticated atmosphere. It's cozy yet funky. I love that you can see the ""behind the scenes"" there is an open kitchen and the big giant brew tanks (thats clearly not the technical term). You feel like part of the action. And the food coming out of there kitchen is INSANE!!! I tried the duck and Apple flat bread, gala apples, blue cheese, carmalized onions, duck confit, and bacon. Unbelievable!!! I had a flight and sampled a few of their craft brews. Authentic and artsy tastes I can't wait to go back!!"
"Tarpon Springs, FL",8/29/2016,4.0,the beer and food were great.      nice location   in an old bank redone as a resturant/bar.    we  usually try to stop there when in town.
"Morrisville, PA",1/25/2015,5.0,"We love this place. Bartenders remember you, are friendly and the food is delicious!! Great ,great place!"
"Yardley, PA",7/4/2013,4.0,"I visited The Vault during their first week of operation and was totally unimpressed. But I recently decided to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. We went for a late dinner and the place was packed. Everything we ordered (cheese plate, lamb meatballs and bibb lettuce wedge salad) was really delicious. The atmosphere was very un-Yardley...much more of a city vibe which is a definite plus. I'm not really a beer drinker, so I had the sangria and it was very good. Service was excellent. My only complaint is that the prices are on the high side, but the quality of the food was top notch. I will definitely add the Vault to my list of regular places."
"Langhorne, PA",11/16/2012,4.0,"First time at the Vault for me and my boyfriend, and it won't likely be the last. Its a brewery first and foremost. I love the re-purposed building, the jazz/blues/funk schedule of live musicians on the calendar, and their seasonal locavore mission. The menu is small. The food almost seems like a courtesy so you can have something to absorb some of the alcohol. Being a vegetarian, my options on the menu are limited, but in this part of the country, I'm pretty used to that. We tried the pizza margherita and the butternut brown sweet pizza. The crust is the winner- crisp and thin. Both pizzas were good. My only comment on the sweet pizza was that it could have used a sprinkle of sea salt to balance out the brown sugar. It was like a dessert. Alongside our food, we tried the sweet potato ale and the american blonde. I really liked the sweet potato beer. It's served from a nitro keg so it gets the thick creamy head like a Guiness, giving it a more rounded, creamy mouth feel, but doesn't render it as a heavy bodied beer like a stout. I could taste the sweet spicy notes after every sip, and since I love cinnamon and nutmeg, this beer was the winner over the blonde. I was expecting more of a malty brew when we ordered the blonde, but the strongest flavor there is the hops. I think I will appreciate the blonde more when the weather warms. The service was friendly and attentive. We sat at a table in the upper dining room, but the whole time I was longing to be in the main bar so I could appreciate the decor and see all of the gleaming copper. The beer section on their website has me anticipating some of the beers under development- dunkelweizen, belgian white and brown ale. I'll be back for you all...."
"Corinth, TX",4/26/2013,3.0,"Yummy pizza - we especially enjoyed the ricotta and pepper and buffalo brown sugar.  The antipasto was really good, too.  I am not a beer person, but I had the wine and it was ok.  The husband does the beer thing and likes it enough to come back with me so I can get more pizza, but not enough to make it a beer destination.  We like the decor, waitstaff is hit or miss.  They aren't exactly super nice and welcoming, but I find that standard in the Philly area.  I honestly think I would give it 4 stars, especially considering Yardley doesn't have a whole, whole lot to choose from, but it is really pricey for what you get.  They need to up the portions, or lower the price.  The food and drink are good, but not that good.  That said, I will go back occasionally."
"Freehold, NJ",2/7/2014,5.0,"I haven't been at night, called ahead one Friday night around 8 after a movie and it was a 2 hour wait time! Been twice for late lunch and my husband and I really enjoy it. The food is really good, nice interesting variety - the Buffalo Brown Sugar pizza is a must try at some point! The beer is excellent, again - very nice variety. A must-have - at least 1 s'more. They have beer marshmallows!!!! You can't really taste ""beer"", but still, who doesn't like a s'more??? They make the graham crackers too, which is pretty good. All around great place, will be going as often as possible!"
"Yardley, PA",9/6/2013,5.0,"We are really happy with this place.  It's great to catch up on conversation without all the flat panels everywhere.  Menu and beers keep changing, always something new.  Prices are fair.  Beer is excellent.   We have been over a dozen times and not once disappointed."
"Churchville, PA",12/22/2013,4.0,"I went for the first time last night and was extremely impressed. The food menu is not your normal pub grub, but don't worry it's delicious! The beer is great, not a big selection, but apparently its always rotating with new beers added. The atmosphere is sort of like a speakeasy, they have Jazz playing, the old bank vaults open and is dimly lit. This would be a great date spot.  This is not your typical bar with TVs everywhere, in fact there are no TVs at all!  It's a nice change of pace for the Bucks County bar scene and I'm happy it's in Yardley Borough. Make sure to call an hour ahead to put your name in, it does help! I can't wait to go back and bring my other friends to show them the place."
"Hopewell, NJ",12/14/2013,4.0,"This place keeps getting better and is leaps and bounds better than when they first opened.  The expanded menu of food is really phenomenal and the beer is really good. My only complaint would be that their beer selection is sometimes limited, but I can usually find something to drink that's tasty."
"West View, Pittsburgh, PA",10/28/2013,5.0,We had a great experience at Vault this past weekend. The beer is delicious and unique. The flatbread pizzas were amazing and we had excellent service. We really enjoyed the open layout that allowed us to see the kitchen and the brewing process. It's a very interesting and different place that's definitely worth a visit!
"Morrisville, PA",11/25/2013,1.0,"I would never go back to this restaurant.  I ordered a sangria, which was on the menu, but I was told they didn't have it.  Then I ordered an iced tea, and the waitress brought me a CAN of GREEN TEA which was disgusting.  There were very few menu items to choose from, and portions were very small.  Dessert came in one of those mini glasses, but the menu did not indicate that, so that was also a disappointment.  All in all, a big disappointment and I will not return."
"Jersey City, NJ",3/9/2013,5.0,"I have been to the Vault at least three times and I hope to continue enjoying this excellent bar. The beer is fresh and they have an excellent variety, the food is reasonably priced and delicious. The service is great even when they may have a full bar on a Saturday. I would highly recommend this bar to anyone."
"Philadelphia, PA",10/24/2012,3.0,"Great atmosphere! The vault walk in with the beer in it was awesome! Pretty sure that was the old vault from the bank! The place was very chill and relaxed! The beer was really good! I got the 4 flight sampler! Sweet potato (which was really good), coffee (which oddly enough  was really good), and I forget the other 2 but they were good too! The pizzas were out of this world! I knocked off a star because the pizza cuts were all messed up and uneven, the fact that they don't have togo boxes, they just have foil, and the fact that they have no bar stools!!! All in all I would go back here again! Service was friendly too!"
"Montgomery County, PA",2/23/2013,5.0,"My fiancé is by no means a beer drinker, however, when we visited Vault the first time James (one of the proprietors) gave her a sample of the Belgian Blonde and she loved it. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is inviting and relaxing. My absolute favorite quality of this establishment is their diverse beer selection. Belgian Blonde (similar to Stella Artois), Bavarian Heffewiezen (similar to most southern German beers) Russian Imperial Stout (raved about by critic Tony Mangino- tastes of dark chocolate coffee and cream) Rye IPA (astounding and robust), Extra Special Bitter (various fruit and woodsy undertones) Oatmeal Stout, and Breakfast Stout (great early afternoon beer). They also create seasonal brews such as the Sweet-potato Ale. Also offered are various wines from Crossings VineyardsSince November of 2012 my fiancé and I have been frequent visitors to this unique and wonderful establishment. If you would like to enjoy an upscale dining experience without spending over $100 for it, check these folks out. We've calculated an average price of $35-$45 for two with a 3 course meal."
"Morrisville, PA",12/1/2014,5.0,"beer continues to improve.  food is fantastic--innovative and hip.  atmosphere gorgeous.  summer on the deck is lovely, too."
"Newtown, PA",11/2/2012,5.0,"The Vault is a unique and welcome addition to the Yardley area.  Initially impressive are the space - an amazingly restored 1800's bank - and the atmosphere created by the painstakingly detailed design, relaxed lighting, attentive staff, and good music. We were greeted immediately by the staff and offered a table or place at the smooth concrete bar.  My friends and I had a look at the available brew selections and quickly landed on a choice.   I have never enjoyed craft beer as much as I did at this place.  The Sweet Potato ale, which sounded intriguing was like nothing I have ever tried -- and very, very tasty.  Same with the Coffee brew. I did not get to try the brick oven pizza but did enjoy the generously portioned 3 type hummus  platter.  They support local business in their ingredient choices and offer wines from the local ""Crossing Vineyard"".  Highly recommend this family owned and operated establishment."
"Morrisville, PA",12/29/2012,2.0,"Really not happy about my experience at vault.  While the ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant was all there the food and drink was severely lacking. There were so few choices available and the pizza tasted too sweet to me, not the way pizza sauce should be.  our service was very slow on a busy Friday night where clearly others were waiting.  We ordered potato wedges as appetizers and they came on one wooden slab with a napkin for each person but no plates.  We were given wooden forks to pick them up and had to lean over each other for bites since the plate had to be shared.  My friend asked for a side of the vinaigrette that was to be put on her margarita pizza and the waiters response was we don't have anything to put it in.  Beer is decent but would have liked some liquor options as well as a few non alcoholic selections. Another friend wanted coffee and was again declined.  We ordered mediocre pizzas and when we weren't full at all decided to order some s'mores (the only dessert on the menu) which cost us $2 each for a standard s'more size and again had to eat and deal with the mess over one plate and some cocktail napkins.  I will not go back for dinner."
