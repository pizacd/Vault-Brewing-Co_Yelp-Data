# Vault-Brewing-Co_Yelp-Data
For this project, I used web scraping to create a dataset of Yelp reviews for Vault Brewing Co: A popular brewpub in Bucks County, PA. With that dataset, I analyzed their number of reviews over time and established a relationship between how many reviews Vault gets per month and their average Yelp rating for that given month.
